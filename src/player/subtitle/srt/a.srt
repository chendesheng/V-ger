Darn it. Darn it to heck.

100
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,820
嗯
Yeah.

101
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,630
我可以走了吗
I may leave?

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,150
-你差点摔倒了  -我没事
- You almost fell. - I am fine.

103
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,450
我觉得你有事
You don't look fine.

104
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,870
你看起来很不稳当
You look very unsteady.

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,840
我觉得你该在这儿多待一会儿
I think you should stay here for a while.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,820
这是为了你好
For your own good.

107
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,860
给比尔·弗拉姆一把扫帚
Give Bill Pflaum the broom

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,300
他会扫净西塞罗
and he'll sweep Cicero clean.

109
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,630
支持比尔
Stand beside Bill,

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,060
他会为你们挺身而出
and he'll stand up for you.

111
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,520
干净的城市才能欣欣向荣
A straight town is a healthy town.

112
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,160
对你  对你的家人都好
Healthy for your family and healthy for you.

113
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,850
让我们握手言欢
So let's shake hands...

114
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,430
为什么他们要一大早扰人清梦
Why must they disturb the people so early?

115
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,770
今天是选举日
It's Election Day, dear.

116
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,560
他们有权进行宣传
They have the right to campaign.

117
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,360
他们不该这么大吵大闹
They should not make so much fuss

118
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,450
并且老实听命
and do what they are told.

119
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,360
那可不民主
That wouldn't be very democratic.

120
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,750
说话人人都会
Everybody is talking always.

121
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,950
观点人人都有
Everybody has the opinion.

122
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,990
-可什么事都干不成  -爸爸
- Nothing gets done. - Dada.

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,970
-他得吃东西  -他不想再吃了
- He must eat. - He doesn't want any more.

124
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,590
他还不知道自己想要什么
He does not know what he wants.

125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,120
你的朋友又来了
Your friends have returned.

126
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,730
这都是你自己建的吗
Built this whole thing yourself?

127
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,810
用的罗塞塔模型
The Rosetta model.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,580
种点草  装点一下
Put some grass down there. Spruce it up.

129
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,090
那是夏季的活儿了
That's the summer project.

130
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,650
该上早班了
Time for the morning shift.

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,190
走吧  乔治
Let's go, George.

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,470
今天是个好日子
Gonna be a good day.

133
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,900
你还好吗  威尔
How are you, Will?

134
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,170
我挺好
I'm okay.

135
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,450
受惊了吧
A little shaken?

136
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,550
没有  我...
No, I'm--

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,170
是啊
yeah.

138
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,860
我们会解决这事的
We'll sort this out.

139
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,630
这你要明白
That's the first thing you need to know.

140
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,650
我爸妈
Do my parents--

141
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,760
现在  这事就是你知我知
Right now this is between us.

142
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,920
我会尽力保持这个局面
I'm gonna do my best to keep it that way.

143
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,910
他们还没提出起诉  这是好事
They haven't chargedouou yet. That's very good.

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
我为什么不能走
Why can't I leave?

145
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,980
有些记者赖在楼上大堂不走
There are reporters upstairs living in the lobby

146
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,010
就摩拳擦掌地等着呢
just looking for something to do.

147
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,310
你可以以大案嫌疑人的身份从这儿走出去
You can walk out of here a suspect in a capital case.

148
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,180
他们瞬间就能感觉出来
They'll smell that in a second.

149
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,480
或者你也可以像付罚单的人一样走出去
Or you can walk out like someone who just paid a parking ticket.

150
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,230
这是我们要的效果
That's what we want.

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,010
你得给我点时间
You need to give me a little time.

152
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,760
但是
But you--

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,210
你在费城认识人吧
you know people in Philadelphia, right?

154
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
是认识  我会去找他们的
I do and I'll call on them.

155
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,080
如果有这必要的话
If that's what's required.

156
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,930
我会补偿你的  我保证
I'll make it up to you. I swear.

157
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,820
现在先别去想那些
Don't worry about that now.

158
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,170
我们先谈谈那个男孩
Let's talk about this boy.

159
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,220
我跟那事毫无关系
I didn't have anything to do with it.

160
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,190
我们先谈谈他  就一会儿
Let's just talk about him for a minute.

161
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,380
好了
Now, now.

162
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,470
好了
Now, now.

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
阿灵顿饭店
Hotel Arlington.

164
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,880
请接罗伊·菲利普斯先生
Yes, Mr. Roy Phillips, please.

165
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,530
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

166
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,400
我认为这与你无关吧
I don't see how that's any of your concern.

167
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,010
我怎么知道他还没到...
How do I know he hasn't arrived since the last time I--

168
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,840
是的  相同的留言
Yes. The same message.

169
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,180
没事
It's all right.

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,800
-老大  -给我们让路
- Hey, boss. - Clear a path, boys.

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,610
-早啊  弗兰克  -早
- Hey, Frank. - Morning.

172
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,910
-老大  一切还好啊  -弗兰克
- How's it going, boss? - Frank.

173
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,640
我听说弗拉姆昨晚上挨打了
So I heard Pflaum caught a couple last night.

174
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,710
不  他们只是打碎了他的膝盖
No, they just capped his knees.

175
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,380
这事我可不知道
I don't know nothing about that.

176
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,980
那在二十二街被人割喉的家伙呢
What about the guy that got his throat cut on 22nd?

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,220
喉咙完全割开了吗
His whole throat?

178
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,810
没有  只到这儿
Nah, only to here.

179
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,170
那他还能吹箫喽
So he can still whistle, huh?

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
说得好  弗兰克
That's a good one, Frank.

181
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,870
去看看殿下吧
Let's check in on His Highness.

182
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,130
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

183
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,380
跳蚤杂技表演训练  你说呢

184
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,750
还是放一放吧
Why don't you give it a break?

185
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,490
怎么  好像你自己没吸过一样
What, like you ain't been touching it?

186
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,700
今天有正事
We got business today.

187
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,910
我刚说什么了
What'd I just say?

188
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,870
别这样
Don't do that.

189
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,210
怎么  以为我开玩笑呢
What, you think I'm kidding?

190
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,750
把那玩意收起来
Put that thing away.

191
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,440
他他妈来干什么
What the fuck's he doing here?

192
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,980
是你自己要见他
You asked for him, Garibaldi.

193
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,240
你喜欢他昨晚的处事方式
You liked the way he handled himself last night.

194
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,250
是吗

195
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
林子里的事
The woods!

196
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,860

"你还是逃命去吧"

198
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,040
乔治  知道今天是什么日子吗

-竞选日  -愚人节

200
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,120
那些蠢货  会发现自己现了洋相
All the suckers, they're gonna find out that the joke's on them.

201
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,940

你也一样
So have you.

213
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,680
对  我做过  但不是对自己老板
Yes, I have. But not to the guy I work for.

214
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,360
你有点儿野性难驯啊
You got a little wild streak.

215
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,570
是不是
Huh?

216
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,910
看看你今天的表现
Let's see how you do today.

217
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,920
然后我们再谈
Then we'll talk.

218
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,830
因为我们和卖花的还有账要算
'Cause there's some unfinished business with the florist.

219
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,150
回头再说
Leave all that for later.

220
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,930
阿尔
Al.

221
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,700
出去找二十个你最棒的人手
Go out there, pick the 20 best men you can find,

222
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,040
带他们去西电公司大门

帮选民定下主意

225
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,470
他得问他老婆
He needs to ask his wife.

226
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,660
我不需要问任何人
I don't need to ask anyone anything.

227
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,530
我看他是想咬我了
I think he wants to bite me.

228
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,530
别太过分
Respect the boundaries, huh?

229
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,860
家伙还在吗
Still got that piece?

230
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,130
这个吗
You mean this?

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,530
收好
Hold on.

232
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,290
应该用不上  不过...
Shouldn't be any need, but...

233
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,690
你可以吧

来精神精神
Perk yourself up.

235
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,630
我现在就很好
I'm fine right now.

236
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,720
不想做我朋友吗
Don't you want to be my friend?

237
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,200
谁敢跟我们作对
Yeah! Who's gonna fuck with us, huh?

238
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,300
我们开了个派对
We had a party.

239
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,700
你们是谁
Who's we?

240
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,090
就是几个朋友
Just the fellas,

241
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,870
我和舍友克莱顿
my roommate Clayton and me.

242
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,240
几个女孩
Some girls.

243
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,160
派对上有酒
There was liquor.

244
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,890
哪儿来的
Where'd that come from?

245
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,310
威利  你得告诉我
Will, you need to tell me.

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,370
酒是...
It was...

247
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,980
多伊尔先生
Mr. Doyle.

248
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,180
米奇卖你酒
Mickey sold you liquor?

249
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,220
为什么不找我
Why didn't you come to me?

250
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,870
我不想让你知道
I didn't want you to know.

251
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,760
可我现在知道了
But I know now.

252
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,580
懂了吗  威利
You see, Will?

253
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,530
酒是我的酒
The liquor came from me.

254
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,310
而我不知情  现在就有了问题
I didn't know, and now there's a problem.

255
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,510
对不起
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,740
我是个白痴  非常抱歉
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

257
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,930
好吧  米奇卖给你酒
All right, Mickey sold you liquor.

258
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,050
你带回学校
You brought it back to school.

259
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,430
只是个派对
It was just a party.

260
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,340
大家都玩得很开心
everybody was having a good time.

261
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,940
第二天早上亨利就
The next morning Henry was

262
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,450
就不动了
he wasn't moving.

263
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,430
我不知道
I don't know.

264
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,880
他喝的多吗
Did he drink a lot?

265
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,590
跟其他人差不多
As much as anyone else.

266
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,010
-可他是唯一一个...  -是的
- But he was the only one who-- - Yes.

267
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,030
你和他有多熟悉
How well d did you know him?

268
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,450
不熟悉
I didn't.

269
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,320
我以为他是你朋友
I thought he was your friend.

270
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,840
什么
What?

271
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,240
我们吃饭的时候  你管他叫朋友
When we had dinner, you called him a friend.

272
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,610
我在这里没有多少朋友  努基伯父
I don't have a lot of friends here, Uncle Nucky.

273
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,900
我要去跟地方检察官谈谈
I'm going to talk to the district attorney.

274
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,230
如果他只是试探  我会知道
If he's just fishing, then I'll know it

275
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,750
然后一切都会过去
and it all goes away.

276
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,510
你要做的是  振作起来
What you have to do is pull yourself together

277
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,570
记住事实真相
and remember the truth.

278
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,990
我再问你一次
Let me ask you again,

279
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,420
亨利是你的朋友吗
was Henry your friend?

280
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
是的
Yes.

281
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,630
他喝了多少
How much did he drink?

282
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,490
很多
A lot.

283
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,640
你从哪弄的酒
Where did you get the liquor?

284
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,300
我没带酒
I didn't bring any liquor.

285
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,530
很好
Good.

286
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,790
在对您的住所进行检查之后
Following an inspection of your domicile,

287
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,730
警察会提供一份报告...
the officer will submit a report--

288
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,950
达莫迪夫人
Mrs. Darmody?

289
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,740
达莫迪夫人  您没事吧
Mrs. Darmody, are you all right?

290
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,110
您看起来有些憔悴
You're looking a bit peaked.

291
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,620
我昨晚一夜没睡
I didn't sleep last night.

292
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,980
我替您难过
I'm sorry to hear it.

293
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,910
我忽然醒来  想到
I wake up and I think,

294
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,450
"我得去看看汤米"
"Must check on Tommy."

295
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,050
-起床之后才想起...  -是啊
- I'm out of bed and I realize-- - Yes.

296
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,020
才想起他不在家里
I realize he's not there.

297
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,870
然后就睡不着
And there's no getting back to sleep.

298
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,580
一直无法入睡
Not at all.

299
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,700
警官的报告呈上来后
After the officer submits a report,

300
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,590
法院会对抚养权一事
the court will make its final determination

301
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,540
做出最终判决
regarding the question of custody.

302
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,990
我需要做些什么
What do I have to do?

303
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,420
您不需要做任何事情
You don't have to do anything.

304
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,630
警官要看到的是男孩将回到的那个家
What the officer will be looking for is a true picture

305
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,650
最真实的模样
of the home the boy would be returning to.

306
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,700
我正在做一些改动
I'm in a period of transition.

307
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,530
很多家具...
A great deal of the furniture--

308
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,550
家具并不重要
The furniture is not important.

309
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,640
我最近在交往的一位绅士
A gentleman I've been seeing,

310
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,100
是一家重要国家公司的高管
he's highly placed in an important national firm.

311
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,090
责任重大
A great deal of responsibility.

312
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,200
他不想遭人议论
He'd prefer not to have that bandied about.

313
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,990
他以谨慎为荣
He prides himself on discretion.

314
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,410
还有他对装饰的品味
And his taste in decor is...

315
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,750
我能麻烦您倒杯水吗
May I trouble you for a glass of water?

316
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,350
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

317
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,830
-没关系  -我不知道我今天是怎么了
- It's all right. - I don't know what's wrong with me today.

318
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,440
天呐
Oh, dear.

319
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,200
拿着
Here.

320
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,720
攥紧一会儿
Clench it tight for a minute.

321
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
我看起来一定很糟糕
I must look quite a horror.

322
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,770
一点也不
Not at all.

323
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,360
我今天很不在状态
I'm just in such a state.

324
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,130
你到达了一个人生的阶段
You reach a point in life and you

325
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,400
意识到自己撇下的才是最重要的
realize it's what you leave behind that matters.

326
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,530
汤米可能一点都不记得我
And the thought that Tommy might not remember me at all,

327
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,110
就好像我从未存在过
as if I never even existed.

328
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,470
最好一步一步来
Best to take it one step at a time.

329
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,220
我可以做些什么来改变我的状况吗
Is there anything I can do to help my situation?

330
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,850
-我解释过  -我说现在
- As I explained-- - I mean right now.

331
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,740
现在我能做什么吗
Is there anything I can do right now?

332
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,000
-达莫迪夫人  -什么事
- Mrs. Darmody. - Yes?

333
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,840
你最好马上离开
It would be in your best interest

334
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,340
这间办公室
to leave these chambers immediately.

335
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,550
我有约会要迟到了
I'm late for an appointment.

336
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,640
汤普森先生  我是尤金·莫赫恩
Mr. Thompson. Eugene Mulhearne.

337
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,150
助理地方检察官  你好
I'm an assistant district attorney. How do you do?

338
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,500
莫赫恩先生  我要见的不是你
Mr. Mulhearne, you're not who I want to see.

339
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,280
地方检察官让我来见你
The district attorney asked me to meet with you

340
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,290
回答你所问的问题
and answer any questions you might have.

341
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,310
-他为什么不在这  -很遗憾他有要事在身
- Why isn't he here? - He had other obligations, regretfully.

342
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,750
-你们犯错了  -此话怎讲
- You fellows are making a mistake. - How's that?

343
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,140
要把一个的不幸的事件变成什么
Trying to turn a quirk of fate into what?

344
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,570
谋杀案
A manslaughter charge?

345
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,440
十个目击者说他把酒带到了那个派对上
10 separate witnesses say he brought liquor to that party.

346
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,290
这件事值得你浪费时间和精力吗
Is that really worth your time and effort?

347
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,610
如果那个男孩是被毒死的  那就值得
If that boy was poisoned, then yes.

348
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
你从哪里得到那个信息的
Where are you getting that from?

349
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,140
他的症状与中毒相符合
His symptoms are consistent with poisoning.

350
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,300
-酒精中毒  -验尸官可不是这么说的
- Alcohol poisoning. - That's not what the coroner says.

351
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,100
跟我侄子有什么关系
What's that got to do with my nephew?

352
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,450
警局会查出来的
This office intends to find out.

353
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,690
我们别说废话  你的老板和瓦克西·戈登
Let's cut the bullshit. Your boss and Waxey Gordon

354
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,900
今早应我邀请进行了一次谈话
had a conversation this morning at my request

355
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,990
并达成共识  这个事件尽管很让人痛心
and it was agreed that this occurrence,

356
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,280
但不是任何人的过失
terrible as it was, isn't anybody's fault.

357
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,110
外面的那对夫妇
That couple outside,

358
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,370
是亨利·盖恩斯的父母
they're Henry Gaines's parents.

359
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,240
盖恩斯先生是宾州共和党的
Mr. Gaines is a major contributor

360
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,390
一位重要捐款人
to the Pennsylvania Republican Party.

361
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,100
他痛失爱子
He's lost his son

362
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,930
他可不想听到这是什么人生的不幸
and he doesn't want to hear about life's random misfortunes.

363
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,160
肯定要有人承担
Someone's got to answer for this.

364
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,080
我们没有办法
We just don't have any choice.

365
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,880
-你怎么样了  -我很好
- How are we keeping? - I am fine.

366
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,210
你很好
You are fine.

367
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
我欣赏你的骨气
I admire that kind of backbone.

368
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,890
他知道你有多坚强吗
Does he know how tough you are?

369
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,140
谁
Who?

370
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
你的老板  汤普森先生
Your boss, Mr. Thompson.

371
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,500
我明白  好士兵
I understand. Good soldier.

372
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,170
说真的  我越来越喜欢你了
Really, the more I see of you, the more I like.

373
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,750
但是我要问问你
But let me ask this--

374
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,260
他也会为你做这样的事吗
would he do the same for you?

375
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,220
你在这一整天了  埃迪
You've been here all day, Eddie.

376
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,610
没有人找你
No one's asked for you.

377
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,920
木板路上  玛瑙俱乐部没有人找你
Not on the boardwalk, not over at the Onyx Club,

378
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,220
没人打电话  没人发电报
not in the speaks or the wire rooms.

379
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,110
世界抛弃了你
The world is going on without you.

380
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,250
努基·汤普森抛弃了你
Nucky Thompson is going on without you.

381
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,800
此时此刻
And the only person who

382
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,090
唯一一个关心你的人
really cares what happens to you right now

383
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,650
就是我
is me.

384
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,900
你是我的朋友吗
You are my friend?

385
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,200
我不是
No, I am not.

386
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,770
那你是谁
Then who are you?

387
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,670
这就是我
That's who I am.

388
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,810
我要折磨你到死
And I'm going to own every last bit of you.

389
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,320
把自己收拾干净
Clean yourself up.

390
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,140
谁是亨利·盖恩斯
Who was Henry Gaines?

391
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,660
是我的一位朋友
He was a friend of mine.

392
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,990
酒是谁带来的
Who brought the liquor?

393
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,540
不清楚
Beats me.

394
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,200
亨利喝了多少
How much did Henry drink?

395
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,250
很多
A lot.

396
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,090
谁给的他毒酒
Who slipped him the Mickey?

397
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,560
什么
The what?

398
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,460
混了毒药的酒  让他致死的那杯酒
The Mickey Finn. The knockout punch.

399
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,910
里面有什么东西
Whatever was in there.

400
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,080
我  我不知道
I-- I don't, uh--

401
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,450
威利  你不要跟我撒谎
Willie, I have to ask you not to lie just now.

402
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,380
没好处  坦白讲  我也不喜欢
It won't help. And frankly, I don't like it.

403
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,040
我需要知道真相
I need to know what's true

404
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,610
这样我们就能统一口径  明白吗
so we can agree on the rest. Understood?

405
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,340
只是个恶作剧而已
It was supposed to be a gag.

406
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,370
就这样
That's all.

407
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,130
主意是谁出的
Whose idea was it?

408
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,180
我
Mine.

409
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,590
就你自己
Just yours?

410
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,330
威利
Willie.

411
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,560
克莱顿帮我了
Clayton helped me.

412
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,320
你的室友
Your roommate?

413
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,190
亨利呢
And Henry?

414
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,020
他做了什么落到这个下场
What did he do to deserve it?

415
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,850
他觉得他比我强
He thought he was better than me.

416
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,110
但是他没有
But he wasn't.

417
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,160
好吧
All right.

418
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,260
我需要你这么做
Here's what I'm going to need you to do.

419
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,060
工厂的门在那
Factory gates are there,

420
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,300
投票站在那边
polling booth down that way.

421
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,470
你知道该怎么做
You know the situation.

422
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,070
确保他们投票给科林哈
Make sure they vote for Klenha

423
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,820
要不然就不许投
or don't vote at all.

424
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,400
大多数人  不想找麻烦
Most people, they don't want trouble.

425
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,980
谁当市长  谁当总统
Who's the mayor, who's the president,

426
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,220
对他们来说算什么
what's it to them?

427
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,150
我们来管理这个镇
We'll run this burg.

428
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,280
保持财源滚滚
Keep the green flowing.

429
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,670
这才是大家所在乎的
That's all anyone cares about.

430
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,860
奥巴尼恩呢
And O'Banion?

431
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,520
做事的方法有很多种
Lots of ways to do business.

432
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,780
看看进展如何吧
See how it plays out.

433
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,960
家伙带了吗
Got the piece?

434
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,860
在这里
Right here.

435
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,030
那就行动吧
Then hop to it.

436
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,300
不用担心我弟弟  好吗
Don't worry about my brother, okay?

437
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,630
有时他需要被教训一番
Sometimes he just needs a good kick in the ass.

438
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,480
谁来教训他
Who's gonna do the kicking?

439
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
这是预付
It's an advance.

440
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,880
跟着我
Stick with me, huh?

441
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,630
我给你的院子铺草
I'll put grass on your fucking lawn.

442
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:13,310
{\pos(203.693,116.182)}西电公司

443
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,020
我准备好了
I'm ready.

444
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,200
你好
Hello.

445
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,240
一切皆在掌控之中
There's no reason for this to get out of hand.

446
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,780
我们要做的就是提醒他们
All we need to do is remind them

447
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,540
投给共和党
why it's in their own

448
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,010
是最明智之举
best interest to elect the Republican ticket.

449
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,760
一有工人过来  你们就询问
As each worker goes by, I want you to inquire

450
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,290
-他要投给谁  -询问
- how he intends to vote. - Inquire?

451
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,790
他们清楚自己的举动所带来的后果
They already know what can happen

452
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,890
大多数人都不想惹上麻烦
and most people don't want trouble.

453
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,550
我可不是来和平谈判的
I didn't come out for no tea social.

454
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,110
-阿尔说给他们点颜色瞧瞧  -阿尔不管这里
- Al says give it to 'em good. - Al's not in charge here.

455
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,740
-我管  -你管个屁啊
- I am. - You ain't in charge of nothing.

456
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,520
我们把第一个走出来的人狠揍一顿
I say we pick the first guy and clobber him.

457
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,480
-按我说的做  -不然呢
- We're doing it my way. - Or what?

458
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,920
你动手试试
Go ahead and try.

459
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,560
-让一让  -让一让
- Coming through. - Coming through here.

460
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,090
-你投给谁了  -关你屁事儿
- Who you voting for today? - None of your damn business.

461
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,520
-投给共和党  朋友  -与你何干
- Voting Republican, friend? - What's it to you?

462
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,830
有空吗
Got a minute?

463
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,750
等一下
Hold on there.

464
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,110
我在和你说话
I'm talking to you.

465
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,370
站住  天杀的
Just stop for a second, God damn it!

466
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,560
回去  回去
Move back! Move back!

467
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,140
走  乔尼  快走  快走
Come on. Johnny, go, go! Let's go, let's go!

468
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,460
瞧  这些都不必发生的    
You see, none of this had to happen.

469
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,640
快快  让我进去  让我进去
Move, move! Let me in! Let me in!

470
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,100
进去
Get inside!

471
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,170
我...
I, uh...

472
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,490
想找个人
I'm looking for someone.

473
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,730
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name,

474
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,710
但有人告诉我能在这里找到他
but I'm told he could be found here.

475
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,000
我知道我们以前从未见过
I realize we've never met before.

476
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,070
可能你一般不这么做生意
This is probably not how you normally conduct business,

477
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,420
不过我问过别人
but I made some inquires.

478
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,510
所以我来了
Here I am.

479
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,610
你离家太远了  牧羊女
You far from home, Bo Peep.

480
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,610
{\an8}出自美国童谣《小牧羊女》

481
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,020
这里事事都是有关联的
Nothing is very far from anything here.

482
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,220
对吧
Is it?

483
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,050
皮都快被你擦掉了
You're gonna take the skin off.

484
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,480
谁告诉你来这儿的
Who sent you around?

485
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,380
很重要吗
Does that matter?

486
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,980
我得知道我的顾客从哪里来的
I like to know where my customers come from.

487
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,910
我吃过几年舞台饭
I spent several years on the stage.

488
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,480
继续说
Do tell.

489
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,980
-你知道混演艺圈的人是怎么样的  -怎么样
- You know how show people are. - How are they?

490
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,720
我们都喜欢把耳朵贴着地板
We like to keep our ears close to the ground.

491
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,900
你攥着的手袋里有多少呢
Well, what you got tucked up your little pouch there?

492
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,490
我能先看看货吗
May I examine the preparation first?

493
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,410
恐怕不行
No, you mayn't.

494
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,110
我只有这么多
That's all I've got.

495
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,330
那你还是去别处吧
Then you find that lost sheep somewhere else.

496
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,290
我能用其他的东西付款吗
Perhaps we could discuss another form of payment?

497
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,380
我日子不太好过  您贵姓
I'm having a difficult day, Mr...?

498
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,780
-牛津  -牛津先生
- Oxford. - Mr. Oxford.

499
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,650
很艰难的日子
A very difficult day.

500
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,620
某些时候
Just one of those times

501
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,380
需要一些小小的帮助
when you need a little extra help.

502
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,640
仅此而已
That's all this is.

503
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,760
你最好悠着点  小牧羊女
You best go easy now, Little Bo.

504
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,630
我希望我的小羊知道回家
I like my lambs keep coming home.

505
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,420
我去了哪里
Where I went?

506
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,330
特伦顿的师范学校
State Normal over in Trenton.

507
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,510
你阿姨梅布尔也在那里
Your Aunt Mabel was there.

508
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,910
她想做一名教师
She was going to be a teacher.

509
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,390
我不喜欢别的人
I didn't like the idea of other fellas

510
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,040
帮助她的课业
helping her with the classwork.

511
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,320
所以  我也决定做一名教师
So I thought I'd be a teacher, too.

512
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,260
为什么没做成
Why didn't you?

513
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,920
准将需要我
The Commodore needed me.

514
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,650
所以我回来了
And I came back home.

515
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,470
比起个人娱乐之事
There are more important things than what may

516
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,860
还有更重要的事等着你
or may not have happened at some party.

517
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,180
我爸爸不会知道
My father won't know?

518
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,370
没人会知道
No one will know.

519
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,160
汤普森先生  我是劳伦斯·埃斯利
Mr. Thompson. Lawrence Eisley.

520
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,750

521
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,570
谢谢抽时间来

522
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,100
-之前的事情很抱歉  -没关系
- Sorry for the mix-up earlier. - Not to worry.

523
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,600
不过你肯定能理解我的担心
But I'm sure you can appreciate my concern.

524
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,010
如果是我侄子  我肯定和你一样的反应
Oh, I'd feel the same way if it was my nephew.

525
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,470
趁事情闹大之前  我们得弄清楚
We want to get this cleared up before it turns into something.

526
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,910
完全理解
I completely understand.

527
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,150
年轻人
Well, young man,

528
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,700
有人说你能
I'm told you might be able to help us

529
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,210
帮助我们调查这件不幸之事
with this unfortunate event.

530
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,760
你记得什么就告诉他们
You just tell them what happened as best you remember it.

531
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,320
首先  我要说...
First thing I want to say is...

532
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,970
亨利·盖恩斯是我的朋友
Henry Gaines was a pal of mine.

533
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,270
别跑
No running.

534
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,730
你们都是绅士和淑女
We are ladies and gentlemen here.

535
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,920
汤米  我给你说过无数次了  慢慢走
Tommy, I've told you time and time again, walking.

536
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,160
亲爱的
Darling.

537
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,400
是我啊  我是奶奶
It's me. It's Mima.

538
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,830
瞧瞧  真是个帅小伙儿
Look at you. You're a beautiful little man.

539
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,610
我要给你一个见面吻
I'm going to kiss you hello.

540
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,290
我能亲你吗
May I do that?

541
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,320
你在这里能学到东西吗
Are you learning a lot here?

542
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,190
奶奶真替你开心
That makes Mima so happy

543
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
因为我想让你变得聪明
because she wants you to be smart.

544
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,210
想让你变成聪明绝顶的人
She wants you to be the smartest boy there ever was.

545
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,200
我有些事情得告诉你
Now, there's something I have to tell you.

546
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,260
我遇见了一个男人
I met a man.

547
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,490
很好的男人
A very sweet man.

548
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,590
他叫罗伊
His name is Roy.

549
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,940
你肯定会喜欢他的
I think you're going to like him.

550
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,440
我们会生活在一起
We're all going to be together

551
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,960
我们会开开心心的
and that's going to make us so happy.

552
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,070
那样好吗
Won't that be nice?

553
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,990
好啦  好啦
All right. All right.

554
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,560
我有东西给你
I have something for you.

555
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
这个
It's-- here it is.

556
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,980
叫"阿巴真棒"
It's an Abba-Zaba.

557
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,270
我也不知道这是什么
I don't know what that is,

558
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,030
不过肯定很好看
but I'm sure it's wonderful.

559
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,480
这是给你的
And it's for you.

560
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,850
现在我们回家吧
And we're going home now.

561
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,170
家里都收拾好了
It's all been taken care of.

562
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,510
你和我一起
You're going to come home with--

563
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,230

你好  茱莉亚

你好吗
How are you?

566

我很好
I'm very well.

567
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,980
他们是你的亲戚吗
Are these your relations?

568
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,310
他们是老师
They're teachers.

569
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,230
当然
Of course they are.

570
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,770
-那个...  -你来这里做什么
- Well, then... - What are you doing here?

571
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,300
带汤米回家
Just bringing Tommy home.

572
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,740
他不和你住在一起了
He doesn't live with you anymore.

573
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,710
茱莉亚  那得法官说了算
Now, Julia, that's for the judge to decide.

574
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,850
今天我们聊了会儿  他觉得我很有希望
We had a chat today and he was very forthcoming.

575
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,160
走吧  亲爱的  我在这里
Come on, sweetie. I'm here.

576
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,810
不不
No, no.

577
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,840
这样不对
This isn't proper.

578
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,780
今天是美好的一天  这样很不好
It's a beautiful day and this isn't proper.

579
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,900
我们走这边
We're going to walk this way.

580
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,910
好吗  而且不要回头
Okay? And we're not looking back.

581
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,680
-请这边走  女士  -放开我
- This way, ma'am. - Let go of me.

582
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,230
-我们走吧  -放开我
- Let's go. Come on. - Let go of me.

583
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,790
-你们没有这个权利  -请这边走
- You don't have the right. - Now, please.

584
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,680
你们不能把我当污点一样从他生命中抹去
You can't just bleach me out like a laundry stain.

585
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,560
-放开我  -快走
- Let go of me. - Come on.

586
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,450
我得给他"阿巴真棒"的票
I have to give him the Abba-Zaba.

587
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,400
就是这
Here it is.

588
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,560
还不错
Not bad.

589
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,090
还好  老妈挂的窗帘
It's okay. Ma put up the curtains.

590
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
你会弹这个
Can you play this?

591
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,890
不太会
Not really.

592
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,800
你得找个姑娘听你唱情歌
You need to find yourself a girl to serenade.

593
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,790
给你自己一点动力
Give you an incentive.

594
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,220
把门先关上  威尔
Shut the door for a minute, Will.

595
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,280
-努基伯父  -不说教
- Uncle Nucky-- - No lecture.

596
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,660
只是有些话想说
Just a few things I want to say.

597
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,950
不管发生了什么  都过去了
Whatever occurred, it's over.

598
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,720
但以后时不常  你会想起
But every now and then you'll think

599
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,850
这个连长什么样都记不清的男孩
about the terrible thing that happened to a boy

600
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,900
身上发生的惨剧
whose face you can't quite remember.

601
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,930
我保证  你会没事的
I promise, you can live with it.

602
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,710
你就是这样的吗
Is that what you do?

603
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,540
你会毕业
You're going to graduate.

604
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,280
如果有必要
We'll get you into another school

605
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,020
我们会帮你转学
if that's what's necessary.

606
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,920
现在这都不重要
It's not important now.

607
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,400
你担心其他人怎么说
You worry about what other people might say.

608
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,690
担心那些被你成为朋友的人
You worry about someone you call a friend.

609
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,070
这些都不重要
None of that matters.

610
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,970
唯一可以依赖的东西  就是血缘
The only thing you can count on is blood.

611
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,910
在你血管中流淌的
The blood that's in your veins

612
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,920
和在我血管中流淌的一样
and the blood that's in mine.

613
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,680
那些瞧不起你的人
The people who discount you,

614
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,870
他们不知道你是谁
they don't know who you are.

615
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,190
你感受到的愤怒  给我听仔细了
The rage you feel-- listen to me careful--

616
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,940
是一份馈赠
it's a gift.

617
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,210
用好它
Use it.

618
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,120
但是不要让别人看到
But don't let anyone see it.

619
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,940
你知道有我照管你
Know that I'm watching over you.

620
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,860
把你想成为的那个人展现给我
Show me the person you intend to be.

621
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,800
你给地方检察官多少钱
How much did you pay the district attorney?

622
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,910
以后我们再谈这个
One day we'll talk about all that.

623
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,830
现在  你就按我们之前讨论的办
Right now, you just need to stick to what we discussed

624
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,030
其他的事别担心
and not worry about the rest.

625
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,660
抱歉
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,800
-你是克莱顿  -是的  先生
- You're Clayton? - Yes, sir.

627
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,230
你是威利的父亲
You're Willie's father?

628
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,040
不  是他伯父
No, his uncle.

629
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,470
您怎么
How do you--

630
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,710
我晚会再回来
I'll come back later.

631
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,090
-我只是  -没关系
- I was just-- - It's all right.

632
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,050
我得回家了
I have to get back home.

633
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,560
记住我说的话
Remember what we talked about.

634
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,030
很高兴见到你  克莱顿
It's good to meet you, Clayton.

635
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,990
你这一整天都去哪了
Where the hell have you been all day?

636
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,570
不想去上课
Didn't feel like going to class.

637
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,520
天呐  威尔  大家都在讨论
Christ, Will, everybody's talking about--

638
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,310
我们要怎么办
what are we gonna do?

639
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,650
都解决了
It's taken care of.

640
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,160
什么意思
What does that mean?

641
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,430
问题解决了
It's been taken care of.

642
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,430
他死了  威尔  你不能就这么
He's dead, Will. That's not just gonna go--

643
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,100
克莱顿  我得学习
Clayton, I have to study.

644
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,920
什么
What?

645
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,470
每天商学课考试
There's a test in commerce tomorrow

646
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,480
我得学习
and I have to study.

647
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,300
你让我一个人待会怎么样
So how about you leave me alone?

648
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,440
让我来看看你有什么本事  男子汉
Let's see what you got, tough guy.

649
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,680
穆勒

650
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,420
闪开  闪开
Out of the way. Move. Move.

651
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,920
这他妈是怎么回事

一个人数劣势的情况
A numerically disadvantaged situation.

653
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,170
什么
A what?

654
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,850
六车人在路上
There's six carloads on the way.

655
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,490
在人到之前别让他们出门
Just keep 'em behind that gate until they get here.

656
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,510
来  让我来
Come on, let me at 'em!

657
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,860
给你  尝尝这个
Here, take that!

658
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,740
没必要发生冲突  伙计们
Ain't no need for any grief, fellas.

659
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,480
结果早就定了

663
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,230
我们在等警察
We're waiting for the cops.

00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,930
没什么线索
There's not much more to go on.

808
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,920
据说是芝加哥警局的特警
Word has it that it was Chicago's Detectives' Special Squad.

809
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,830
他们说有人打电话来

810
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,710
说不能相信西塞罗警局
the Cicero Police couldn't be trusted.

811
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,850
他枪都没掏出来
He never got his gun out.

812
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,900
那群王八蛋们
Every fucking thing that crawls

813
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,990
都他妈要付出代价
is gonna pay.

814
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,770
克莱顿·戴维斯
Clayton Davies?

815
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,030
我们是费城警局的
We're with the Philadelphia Police.

816
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,040
你不该来这
You're not supposed to be up here.

817
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,060
那就别让人看见我
Then you better not let anyone see me.

818
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,570
你知道发生什么了吗
Do you know what happened?

819

克莱顿被捕了
They arrested Clayton.

820
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,090

警察来了  把他抓走了
The police came and they arrested him.

822

说他给亨利下毒

823
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,110
为什么要给他下毒
Why would somebody do something like that?

824
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,740
你是怎么回事
The hell happened to you?

825
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,730
什么意思
What do you mean?

826
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,940
你好像在长凳上过的夜
You look like you slept on a bench.

827
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,060
我跟老朋友在一起
I spent the night with old friends.

828
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,400
喝了很多酒  非常多
There was much drinking. Too much.

829
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,370
不知不觉天就亮了
And the night became morning.

830
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,100
你要是想消失一整天
If you're going to disappear for an entire day--

831

不会有下次了

832
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,800
你这份工作是不该让我操心的  明白吗
I shouldn't have to worry about that. You understand?

833
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,410
我只说这么多
That's all I'm saying.

834
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,520
这份工作是你主动要求的
It's a responsibility that you asked for.

835
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,110
-你吃了吗  -不饿
- Have you eaten? - I am not hungry.

836
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,230
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

837
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:41,940
等等
Hold on.

838
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,010
过来
Come over here.

839
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:09,870
看到没
Well?

840
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,010
要是你在身边  就没这么麻烦了
