- Look, you're scaring me. - I'm scared. 

151
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,690
我从未见过这样的病  这是史无前例的
I've never seen anything like this. Nobody has. 

152
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,720
如果事情这样紧急  为何没有一点风声呢
If there's some big emergency why isn't there any news about it?

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,380
为什么政府不警告我们  而是在到处找你呢
Why isn't the government warning us instead of looking for you.

154
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,310
他们想混淆视听
They're trying to turn it around on me.

155
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,850
我知道的太多了  也许这听起来很疯狂
Look, I know too much. Maybe that sounds crazy. 

156
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,610
你得把手机扔了  不然他们会追踪到你的
You gotta get rid of your phone, dad. They can use it to trace you.

157
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,520
我已经这么做了
I did that already.

158
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,560
上楼去准备下  要去学校了
Go upstairs and get ready for school.

159
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
上楼去  扎克
Upstairs, Zack.

160
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,910
你吓到我了  也会吓到你儿子的
You're scaring me and you're going to scare your son.

161
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,840
是因为监护权听证会吗
Is it the custody hearing?

162
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,220
你是终于崩溃了吗
I mean, have you finally snapped?

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,210
你今早喝了多少酒  伊弗
How many drinks have you had this morning, Eph?

164
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,570
凯莉  你了解我的  你必须这么做
You know me Kelly. You need to do this.

165
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,680
你不能再给我下命令了
Look, you need to stop giving me orders, ok?

166
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,120
何况你说过多少次
Besides, how many times have you said

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,590
「人跑不过病毒」
"You can't outrun a virus"?

168
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,990
这次你至少得试试
Well this one, you need to try.

169
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,110
如果不是事关重要  我不会这么说的
Look, I wouldn't be saying this if it wasn't important!

170
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,490
你可以占用我的办公室  把它拆掉
You can take my office, you can tear it down,

171
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,460
你可以把它改造成游戏室  我无所谓
you can turn it into a game room, I don't give a shit.

172
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,000
但现在事关重大
But this matters.

173
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,750
-你居然打给联调局  -你这个傻逼
- You called the FBI? - Goddamn fool.

174
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,670
放轻松  博士  把你的手放在脑后
Take it easy, doctor. Put your hands behind your head.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
好了博士  站着那别动
Ok, doc. Stop right there.

176
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,530
我的天哪  伊弗
My God, Eph.

177
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,300
我们只是要问你几个问题
We just have a few questions for you.

178
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,400
把手放在脑后
Put your hands behind your head!

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,430
快跑
Run.

180
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,430
他们让他坐在了后座
They left with him in the backseat.

181
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,450
我觉得邻居们应该没看到
I don't think any of the neighbours noticed anything.

182
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,640
你为什么要这么做
Why did you do that?

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,780
做什么  按照联调局的要求打给他们吗
What? Call the FBI as they instructed us to do?

184
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,420
怎么  你想让我们变成从犯吗
What? You want us to be an accessory to whatever?

185
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,690
这不是你可以决定的事
It wasn't your call to make.

186
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,870
-他强行闯入了我们家  -是我的家
- He forced his way into our house. - Into my house!

187
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,730
他是我前夫  我来决定怎么对待他
My ex-husband. And I will decide how to deal with him.

188
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,070
你居然在袒护他
You, you're actually defending him.

189
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,900
-为什么他们要抓走爸爸  -这只是
- Why did they arrest dad? - You know what? It was just

190
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,440
一个天大的误会  我们会解决的
a big misunderstanding and we're going to sort it out.

191
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,640
-我们要去佛蒙特州吗  -也许我们该去
- Are we going to Vermont? - You know what? Maybe we should.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
-为了安全起见  -你说真的吗
- Just to be safe. - Are you kidding me?

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
然后呢  你就打算让扎克这么逃课了
And do what? You're just going to pull Zack out of school?

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,610
而且这么晚了你去找谁给你替课
And how are you going to find a substitute for your class this late?

195
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,110
抱歉  我可不要因为你前夫的胡扯丢了饭碗
I'm sorry, but I'm not losing my job because your ex went crazy.

196
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,820
不许这么说我爸爸
Don't say that about him!

197
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
扎克  到车里等我好吗
Zack, just go wait in the car for me, ok?

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,510
我知道你现在不开心  考虑到以前的事
Look, I know you're upset. With your history...

不  你闭上嘴听我说
No, you shut your mouth and you listen to me.

这是我的家庭  我的生活
This is my family, my life.

201
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,990
我让你参与其中
I invited you in,

202
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,270
你只是一个客人
you are a guest

203
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,700
-而你需要有个客人的样子  -客人
- and you need to start acting like one. - A guest?

204
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,670
也许这是个错误  也许我进展太快了
Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I acted too quickly.

205
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,340
不不  我们的事我们心里有数  我在这
No no no. We know what we're doing here, ok? I'm here.
