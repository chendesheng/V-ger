00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,336
President reagan:
<i>Air and naval forces</i>

00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,039
<i>Launched a series of strikes</i>

<i>Pan am flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the town of lockerbie.</i>

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,542
Reagan:
<i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror</i>

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,145
<i>In africa, europe,</i>
<i>the middle east.</i>

6
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:16,115
President george h.W. Bush:
<i>This will not stand, this</i>
<i>aggression against, uh, kuwait.</i>

7
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,616
Reagan:
<i>This relentless pursuit</i>
<i>of terror.</i>

8
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,351
President george w. Bush:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,020
Reporter:
<i>The uss</i> cole <i>was attacked</i>

10
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,154
<i>While refueling in</i>
<i>the port of aden.</i>

11
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,123
This was an act of terrorism.

12
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,458
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,028
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,129
Is one of the good old
favorites.

15
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,631
...Until something stops him.

16
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,701
Carrie: <i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

17
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>And I never saw it coming.</i>

18
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,305
Man: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the world trade center.</i>

19
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,674
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

20
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:46,845
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

21
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,714
(speaking arabic)

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,920
Saul: <i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

23
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,855
<i>I've ever known.</i>

24
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,557
Carrie:
<i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who got it wrong.</i>

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,826
<i>I'm the only one</i>

26
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,665

<i>Take 'em.</i>

<i>Take 'em all.</i>

<i>Previously on</i> homeland...

29
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,282
It wasn't me.

30
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,517
It wasn't me.

31
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,186
We have to go.

32
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,520
What do you mean?
Go where?

33
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,888
No one else will believe you.

34
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,457
What are we doing here?

35
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,525
Activating
my insurance policy.

36
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,294
A friend, June, will
meet us at the border.

37
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,428
She'll drive us up to montreal

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,696
Where we get onto
a fishing boat,

39
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,364
Which takes us up
to newfoundland.

40
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>The border's in a few miles.</i>

41
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,936
You're not coming, are you?

42
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,405
I can't now.

43
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,040
Frank:
<i>Have you seen the paper yet?</i>

44
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,810
<i>Cia officer linked</i>
<i>to langley bomber.</i>

45
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,079
The case officer in question,

46
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,482
She's been diagnosed as bipolar.

47
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,885
It's carrie.

48
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,320
She called a reporter.

49
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,322
Apparently she thinks
it's important they quote,

50
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,424
"hear her side
of the story."

51
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:08,127
The cia gave you
that story to set me up.

52
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,228
For what?

53
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,896
Nicholas brody is
not responsible

54
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,231
For the explosion at langley.

55
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,932
Did saul berenson know
when he testified

56
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,967
Before the senate subcommittee?

57
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,101
Of course he did.

58
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,736
Everything he said was bullshit.

59
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,072
Did you tell anyone
that I was coming here?

60
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,241
We've got a psychiatric
detention order.

61
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,343
You know she's off
her meds, right?

62
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,345
Unless you think
that's a good idea.

63
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,380
You really have to help me.

64
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,352
This is fucking sham!

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,261
Saul: <i>Carrie.</i>

66
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,429
I am so sorry.

67
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,703
Fuck...

68
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,541
You, saul.

69
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,067

(speaking spanish)

81
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,454
Shit what happened to him?

82
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,855
Something went wrong.

83
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,457
I assumed.

84
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,059
Um, across the border.

85
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,838
<i>Dios mío.</i>

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,339
Esme!

87
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,576
(speaking spanish)

88
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,884
I'm going to take
a look at you now, okay?

89
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,387
Are you a doctor?

90
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,722
(mumbles)

91
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,891
Interesting question.

92
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,163
(brody yelling)

93
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:42,100
I know.

94
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,103
I know, I know it hurts.

95
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:49,074
Could someone do something
about the lights?

96
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,076
(speaks spanish)

97
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,446
You've lost a lot of blood.

98
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,381
You're in hypovolemic shock.

99
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,384
We're going to try
to repair the bleeds.

100
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,586
(grunting)

101
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,291
This will help
with the pain.

102
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,762
Enough, enough.

103
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,664
We don't want to stop his heart.

104
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,870
Okay, paco?

105
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,239
I need you
to hold something for me.

106
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,541
Can you do that?

107
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,575
Give me your hand.

108
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,112
And put it right here.

109
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,549
Right... There.

110
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,783
Can you feel it?
Uh-huh.

111
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,552
It's beating-- boom, boom, boom?

112
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,553
Boom, boom, boom.

113
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,987
Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,023
Pinch it. Pinch.

115
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,126
Don't let go.

116
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,897
Where are my lights?

117
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,133
Can't work
with a flickering light.

118
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,001
(speaking in spanish)

119
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,904
Where are my lights?

120
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,706
(grunting)

121
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,078
Well done.

122
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,417
Ah.

123
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,152
Esme?

124
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,307
Will he live?

125
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,942
Depends.

126
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,013
How old were those
antibiotics you got me?

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,851
Oh, he'll make it.

128
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,388
He's a strong one.

129
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,823
You know who he is.

130
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,260
Absolutely no idea.

131
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,496
Just an anonymous stranger

132
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:55,100
With two bullets in his gut.

133
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,070
Though, hypothetically...

134
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,039
I'm-I'm...

135
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,041
I'm wondering.

136
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,480
An american fugitive falls
in your lap.

137
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,650
One with a bounty on his head.

138
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,985
$10 million, dead or alive.

139
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,724
Why go through a world
of trouble to save him...

140
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,494
Instead of just collecting
the reward?

141
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,596
Maybe someone did you

142
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,765
A favor once.

143
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,337
Must be some favor.

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,107
(yells)

145
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,677

(speaking in spanish)

147
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,681
Be still.

(sobbing)

151
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,264
No fever.

152
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,967
(speaks spanish)

153
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,377
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,506
Ah, thank you.

155
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,846
Ah, thank... Thank you.

156
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,149
Thanks.

No!

(speaking spanish)

163
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,677
No, I want to get up.

164
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,180
I want... (groans)

165
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,533
No more.

166
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,435
I can't think.

167
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,004
No more, please.

168
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,114
God.

169
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,583
No.

00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,785
Will you help me
get up, please?

171
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,986
No. (speaking spanish)

172
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,556
(groans)

173
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,525
(spanish continues)

174
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,428
Need to see.

175
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,496
No.

176
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,731
(groans)

177
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,699
(panting)

178
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,656
(distant singing)

179
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,599
Where am I?

180
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,335
El niño:
Caracas.

181
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,537
Your new home.

182
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,007
You shouldn't be up.

183
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,409
(speaking spanish)

184
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,645
You need to rest.

185
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,614
(spanish continues)

186
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,088
(panting, spanish continues)

187
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,061
You're lucky to be alive,
you know.

188
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,964
Those columbians,
they nearly killed you.

189
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,733
There's a bounty on your head.

190
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,301
I know.

191
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,369
A big one.

192
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,539
You're never safe,
even here with me.

193
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,176
My wallet's missing,

194
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,545
And so is my passport.

195
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,213
Somebody took them.

196
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,982
I couldn't stop him.

197
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,818
I need my passport for travel.

198
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,219
(chuckles)

199
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,388
Don't worry about that.

200
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,825
I can't get another one.

201
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,494
Just-just get better now.

202
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,564
We'll try to find out
who took your things.

203
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,402
(speaking spanish)

204
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,811
Why are you trying
to help me?

205
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,685
You know carrie mathison.

206
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,856
So do I.

207
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,659
Stay here on this floor.

208
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,718


209
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,812


210
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,814
(speaks spanish)

211
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,193
Thank you.

212
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,674
(groans)

213
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,679
(sighing)

214
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,688
(low, indistinct conversations)

215
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,149
Oh, it feels good.

216
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:34,919
To be walking.

217
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,589
Walking?

218
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,826
Walking.

219
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,761
(groans)

220
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,107
We're walking.

221
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,342
We're walking.

222
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,011
Yes, we're walking.

223
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,979
We're walking.

224
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,850
With a cane.

225
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,618
<i>Bastón.</i>

226
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
<i>Bastón?</i>

227
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,589
(indistinct talking)

228
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,032
We're walking with a cane.

229
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,535
We're walking with a cane.

230
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,670
(laughter)

231
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,943
Aah!

232
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,486
(music playing distantly)

233
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,046


234
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,759
<i>Agua?</i>

235
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,261
Oh, yes, yeah.

236
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,396
Thanks.

237
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,501
(panting)

238
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,509
Gracias.

239
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,080
(panting continues)

240
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,555
I prescribe rest.

241
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,191
You go gallivanting about.

242
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,426
Paco?

243
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,130
Trekking clear
across the building,

244
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,531
What were you thinking?

245
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,369
Esme?

246
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,910
No.

247
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,247
You sure?

248
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,450
You seem like you're
in a lot of pain.

249
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,420
I'll survive.

250
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,589
Guess you're good
at that, aren't you?

251
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,563
So, what'd you make of it?

252
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,032
What?

253
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,001
What you saw.

254
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:41,105
This abscess beyond healing
we call home.

255
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,176
They call it the tower of david.

256
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,444
Not for king david,

257
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,412
Heaven forbid.

258
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,114
For david brillembourg,

259
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,950
The particularly
egomaniacal banker

260
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,921
Unfortunately, before
it was completed,

261
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,289
David died.

262
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,358
Then the whole economy died,

263
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,559
Construction stopped,

264
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,695
The squatters all moved in,

265
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,164
And viola.

266
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,371
Scooch.

267
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,872
Well, if you hate it...

268
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,041
Did I say I hate it?

269
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,579
So why are you here?

270
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,082
That's a dangerous question.

271
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:29,053
"why am <i>I</i> here?"

272
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:32,323
Leads to "why are you here?"

273
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,792
You see?

274
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,731
We're here

275
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,633
Because the world
outside can be...

276
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,202
Judgmental and cruel?

277
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,544
We're here because this
is the place that accepts us.

278
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,750
We're here
because we belong here.

279
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,085
(sighs)

280
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,154
I'm not staying.

281
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,822
Of course not.

282
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,260
I just need
to get my strength back.

283
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,262
Don't we all

284
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:15,032
Need to get our strength back?

285
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,237
(banging)

286
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,783
(panting)

287
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,023
(distant singing)

288
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,610
(quietly singing along)

289
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,988
(shouts in spanish)

290
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,991
(spanish continues)

291
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,311
(banging)

292
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,317
(panting)

293
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,600
Come.

294
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,873
Where?

295
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,648
(panting continues)

296
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,803
(horns honking distantly)

297
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,917
Yours.

298
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,920
(sighs)

299
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,922
Thanks.

300
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,123
Is this...

301
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,025
Is this him?

302
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,094
Is this the man

303
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,829
That robbed you?

304
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,100
Is it?

305
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,004
He says he did it.

306
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,107
Yeah, okay, but...

307
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,178
No, no, no, wait, wait a second.

308
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,179
No!

309
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,447
No, no, don't!

310
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,948
(screaming)
get the...

311
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,317
(thuds)

312
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,386
You didn't have to kill him!

313
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,188
No?

314
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,556
No, you didn't.

315
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,725
Fine. (speaks spanish)

316
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,629
We let people rob us,
no problem.

317
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,031
And then what
if they recognize you

318
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,733
With ten million dollars
on your head?

319
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,535
What stops them from saying,

320
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,470
"I know where he is."

321
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,438
Hmm?

322
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,147
Back to your room.

323
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,754
(speaking spanish)

324
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,236
(speaking spanish)

325
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,944
Esme:
Where you go?

326
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,080
Somewhere else.

327
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,686
Do you have money?

328
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,687
I need money.

329
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,423
<i>Dinaro?</i>

330
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,091
<i>Dinaro!</i>
<i>Do you have any?</i>

331
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,533
Don't go.

332
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,301
I can't stay here.

333
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,720
(indistinct conversations,
music playing)

334
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,855
(man shouting)

335
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,558
You stop!

336
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,293
I'm going out.

337
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,829
(gun cocks)

338
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,968
I need to leave.

339
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,671
Go out there.

340
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,239
I need to get out of here.

341
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,374
El niño:
Where?

342
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,143
Where you think you go?

343
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,746
Out.

344
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,482
Out... Out where?

345
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,085
To the next place.

346
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,021
I've been taken from
one place to the next.

347
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,455
From here to there
to here...

348
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:39,757
You were nearly killed.

349
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,592
I can't stay here.

350
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:42,760
Why?

351
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,795
It's...

352
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,996
It's not good enough?

353
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,364
No, I didn't mean that.

354
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,599
Not, not good enough for you?

355
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:51,301
Huh? (laughs)

356
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,203
Oh, I guess it's
because of that-that thief?

357
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,005
He... He upset you?

358
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,876
Look...

359
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,612
I appreciate all you've
done for me, okay?

360
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:02,613
But I'm better now.

361
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:03,981
What does that mean?

362
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,616
Means I can make it on my own.

363
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,451
I just need to get
to the next place.

364
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,486
There's no next place.

365
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,588
What? There has to be.

366
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,326
No.

367
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,295
Does carrie know I'm here?
Does she?

368
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,863
No one can know.

369
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,734
We have to tell her.

370
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:24,735
I call her on the phone?

371
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,470
Huh?
No, I didn't mean that.

372
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,306
A postcard then?
Or we just call the cia,

373
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:33,110
They give us $10 million--
split it, eh... Even steven?

374
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,414
I tell you last time,

375
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:42,486
Where you are,
carrie doesn't want to know.

376
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,756
This is it for you.

377
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,625
End of the line.

378
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,490
El niño thinks
you're an ingrate.

379
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,594
I assured him
you're just confused.

380
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,036
But he's right, you know.

381
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,539
This is your home.

382
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,476
It isn't easy to accept--

383
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,711
Believe me, I know.

384
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,446
Not how you pictured yourself.

385
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,682
There must be some mistake,
and on and on.

386
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,890
The voices in your head are
not your friends right now.

387
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,458
You have to make them go away.

388
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,067
The germans who invented it...

389
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,738
...Had a special name
for a medicine

390
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,407
Powerful enough to do just that.

391
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,812
"hero-isch."

392
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,480
"heroic."

393
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,183
The drug is.

394
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,318
So you don't have to be.

395
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,595
Get out.

396
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,334
Come, paco.

397
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,335
Come, come.

398
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,680
I slept six whole hours
yesterday.

399
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,149
I can't remember the last
time that happened, so...

400
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,786
Yeah, all things considered,
I feel pretty damn lucid.

401
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:57,521
And you're drinking
enough water?

402
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,389
I think so.

403
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,125
Any headaches?

404
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,961
They'll go away.

405
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,062
This isn't my first time

406
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,897
Acclimating to lithium,
you know?

407
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,366
Dizzy spells?

408
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,734
One or two.

409
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,370
Nothing unbearable.

410
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,245
I was wondering if you could
tell saul berenson

411
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,647
How much better I'm doing.

412
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,084
What... Makes you think
I'm in touch with saul berenson?

413
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,353
We both know who you're writing
those notes for.

414
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:32,089
You think I'm reporting back
to the cia?

415
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,156
I know you are.

416
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,725
And that's fine.

417
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,993
Just...

418
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,561
Tell saul

419
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,162
I'm sorry I fucked up.

420
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,831
It won't happen again.

421
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,833
What do you mean
you fucked up?

422
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,002
I mean...
I went off my meds.

423
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,037
Clearly, that was a bad idea.

424
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,140
You told dr. Harlan
your meds dulled you.

425
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,778
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

426
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,415
This is quite
the sea change for you.

427
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,120
(sighs)

428
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,088
After three weeks
in here, it's...

429
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,024
Hard to hold on to any grudges.

430
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,826
So saul did you a favor
putting you in the hospital.

431
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,197
Yes.

432
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,233
Removing you from
a delusional relationship.

433
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,268
With a suspected
terrorist, no less.

434
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,170
That was his testimony,
wasn't it?

435
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,375
It was.

436
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,544
You're saying that
was the right thing to do?

437
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,415
Yes.

438
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,517
And you honestly
believe that?

439
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,387
Carrie...

440
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,123
I want you to answer truthfully.

441
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,458
I want you to recover.

442
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,560
From what?

443
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,329
We both know I'm not here
because I'm crazy.

444
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,397
I'm here because they don't
know where else to put me.

445
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,266
No one said you were crazy.
Well, no one had to.

446
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,301
I'm in a fucking psych ward.

447
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,939
Look...

448
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,274
(sighs)

449
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,810
The sooner I can talk to saul,
the sooner I can go home

450
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:04,147
And you can go back to doing
something useful with your life.

451
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,322
W-what are you writing?

452
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,093
I was out of line just then.

453
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,261
I'm sorry. I...

454
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,863
You want to earn
your visiting privileges,

455
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,366
You'll have to be a bit
more cooperative than that.

456
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,967
I know.

457
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,837
And then there's the question of
the efficacy of your medication.

458
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,840
All right, I'm sorry, I just...

459
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,681
Will you please tell saul
that I'm better?

460
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,949
(grunting quietly)

461
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Esme:
Hey...

462
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,991
They see you.

463
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:22,492
You can't do that.

464
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,693
I have to.

465
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,661
No...

466
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,665
He know.
He know.

467
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,966
He know what happened.

468
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,172
Listen. Stop.

469
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,574
(men speaking spanish
in distance)

470
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,778
Please...

471
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,413
I can't stay here.

472
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,750
I can't.

473
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,751
I have to leave.

474
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:48,919
I have to go out there.

475
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,187
I can't live here.

476
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,322
(speaking spanish)

477
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,324
<i>Aquì.</i>

478
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,728
No   <i>aquì.</i>

479
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,963
(panting)

480
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,269
I'll die here.

481
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,606
No place to go.

482
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,779
There is a place.

483
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,981
There is.

484
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,885
There is...

485
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,287
There is somewhere to go.

486
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,288
No. My father say...

487
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,557
There is a place.

488
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,326
The mosque.

489
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,798
Will you help me?

490
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,075
Well, well...

491
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,310
That's really quite something.

492
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,678
Is that a little balcony?

493
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,580
It is, yeah.

494
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,349
It's just darling.
Thanks.

495
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:56,520
Mike, sarah--
come look at this.

496
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,956
Isn't that lovely?

497
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,092
Look at all the detail.

498
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:03,593
Can I use the restroom?

499
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,762
Of course.

500
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,766
Jim, why don't you put
some paint on that?

501
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,676
Carrie, are you in here?

502
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,877
Yeah, I'm fine...
What, what...

503
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,811
I needed to get
out of there.

504
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,113
...What happened?
Are you all right?

505
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,281
Yeah, I'm fine.
You're...

506
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,682
I just had to get
out of there.
...Bleeding.

507
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,184
What?

508
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,485
Oh, shit.

509
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:31,988
Honey, if you are hurting
yourself, I need to know.

510
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,390
No, I said I'm fine.

511
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,792
I know, carrie,
what you said.

512
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,328
Let me see.

513
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,363
Look, I had a bad moment--
that's all.

514
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,731
I'm-I'm taking my lithium.

515
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,466
(voice breaking):
I'm going to group.

516
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,302
I'm doing everything
that's asked of me.

517
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,637
I'm... Okay. Okay.

518
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,006
(crying)
that's it. That's it.

519
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,308
Okay?

520
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,309
That's all right.

521
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,476
It's all right now.

522
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,645
Okay, that's all right.

523
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,547
(carrie sobs)

524
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,982
Please don't tell.

525
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,483
Okay.

526
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,722
(sobs quietly)

527
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,626
(stall door bangs shut)

528
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,741
(conversing in spanish)

529
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,846
(conversing in spanish)

530
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,977


531
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,650
So promise me this will
not happen again.

532
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,484
I promise.

533
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,219
Because, if it does...
It won't.

534
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,220
I was just frustrated.

535
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,755
Okay. When I get frustrated,

536
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,524
I take a deep breath
and I count to ten.

537
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,096
Hey, carrie,
keep your head up.

538
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,399
It's not like they're
going to forget you in here.

539
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,401
Someone's already
come by to check on you.

540
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:27,237
Who?
I'm not sure.

541
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,505
What, you didn't get his name?

542
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,473
Nope. He didn't say.

543
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,142
He asked about you,
how you're doing.

544
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,310
We don't
tell 'em anything.

545
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,477
Well, if he comes again,
let me know.

546
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,779
I need to see him.

547
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,481
Okay, as soon as you're
granted visiting privileges...

548
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,482
No. Sooner than that.

549
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,750
It's saul. Has to be.

550
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,618
Okay, honey,

551
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,520
Let's get you back
to group, okay?

552
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,155
Will you promise me?

553
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,525
Carrie, I've already
risked my job once.

554
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,960
And this is the last favor
I'll ask. I mean it.

555
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,229
(sighs)

556
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,270
People see you.

557
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,172
They know.

558
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,442
Oh, the imam
won't turn me in.

559
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,043
He'll help me.

560
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,012
I'm a muslim.

561
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,482
Me...

562
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,017
Me muslim.

563
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,322
See? Refuge.

564
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,925
Esme:
<i>Refugio.</i>

565
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,207
<i>Perfecto.</i>

566
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,276
(sighs)

567
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,114
Take me with you.

568
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,183
What? No.

569
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,519
You can't leave me here.

570
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,221
No, I can't take you with me.

571
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,189
No, I...

572
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,824
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

573
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,159
I can't.

574
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,261
I can't. I...

575
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,096
I'm sorry.

576
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,342
<i>Salaam alaykum.</i>

577
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:14,077
<i>Alaykum salaam.</i>

578
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,312
(brody speaking arabic)

579
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,309


580
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,308


581
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,390
(speaking arabic)

582
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,756


583
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,471
Someone's here to see me.

584
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,639
I need an elevator key.

585
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,574
If you could just
wait in the rec room.

586
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,643
No, I have a visitor.
I have to see him.

587
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:27,877
You're still not
on the list.

588
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,879
Please?
He's waiting for me.

589
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,915
I need you to calm down.

590
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:33,216
I am calm.

591
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,684
Where's abby?

592
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:35,919
She's on break.

593
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,487
Well, will you go get her?

594
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,721
Because he's
going to leave soon.

595
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,823
Okay, now, let's
talk about this.

596
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,492
Jesus. Where the fuck is abby?

597
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:43,993
What's going on here?
Oh, thank god.

598
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,562
Someone's here to see me.
He's downstairs.

599
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,663
All right, all right.

600
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,031
I-I'll handle this.

601
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,666
We'll take her back
to her room.

602
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,467
Come on. Let's go.

603
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,338
It's saul.

604
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,274
I saw him
through the window.
Keep your voice down.

605
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,252
(shower running)

606
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,192
(sighs)

607
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,967
(sighs)

608
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,349
(grunting and groaning)

609
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,129
(panting)

610
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,136
You're not a muslim.

611
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,007
You are a terrorist.

612
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,855
(gasping)

613
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,157
(imam's wife screaming)

614
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,830
Brody:
No, no, no.

615
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,032
Don't! What are you doing?

616
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,021
Saul?

617
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,157
Saul?

618
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,491
Hi.

619
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,360
Who are you?

620
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:58,494
Paul franklin.

621
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,629
What happened to your head?

622
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,564
Uh, I-I fell.
Did saul send you?

623
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:04,467
No. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't
approve of my being here.

624
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,736
I'm an associate
at bennett, parr and hamilton.

625
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:07,804
We're a law firm.

626
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,005
Yeah, I know.
I've heard of you.

627
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:12,608
Is there anywhere we could speak
a little more privately?

628
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,584
(speaking spanish)

629
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,923
Esme.

630
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:29,092
(door closes)

631
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,330
(grunting and groaning)

632
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,342
I told you, don't leave.

633
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,678
But you go.

634
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,847
This... This is
what happens.

635
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:52,014
We all get trouble.

636
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,349
So now you stay here.

637
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,584
(speaks spanish)

638
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,918
This is your new home.

639
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,688
You will eat here, sleep here,
shit here, die here.

640
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,189
Carrie won't save you.

641
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,691
No one will.

642
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:04,160
Understand?

643
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,998
Do you understand me?

644
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,935
Yes.

645
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,972
And you stay away
from my daughter.

646
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:18,207
You stay away.

647
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,119
(speaks spanish)

648
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,162
Graham:
Been a naughty boy.

649
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,166
Naughty, naughty boy.

650
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,906
Paul:
I heard you had
a difficult hearing.

651
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,440
Carrie:
"difficult" doesn't
really cover it.

652
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:54,377
So we both know you could
be here for quite a while.

653
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,782
One of our partners
would like to meet with you.

654
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,584
Well, he knows
where to find me.

655
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:02,785
I don't think
you understand.

656
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:05,388
I'm talking about
getting you out of here.

657
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,325
You could do that?

658
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,200
Why would you
want to help me?

659
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,969
As I said, I'm here
on behalf of a partner.

660
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,537
And what does he want?

661
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,705
Simply to talk to you.

662
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,873
About?

663
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,974
Whatever it is,

664
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,742
It's important enough
that he sent me.

665
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,213
Look, I know
how that sounds.

666
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,114
In your position,
I'd be paranoid, too.

667
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,717
You don't know the first
thing about my position.

668
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,119
I know you don't
belong here.

669
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,955
That you're not
actually crazy.

670
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,523
And I know you
want nothing more

671
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,692
Than to get out
and go home.

672
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,562
Carrie...

673
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,631
I'm on your side.

674
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,807
Are you all right?

675
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,208
(laughs)

676
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,710
I'm just... I'm
trying to remember

677
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,378
Where I've heard
that line before.

678
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,479
What line?

679
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,648
"I'm on your side."

680
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,883
I know what
you're doing.

681
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,050
What do you mean?

682
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,418
I mean I'm a case officer.

683
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,487
I used to recruit
assets for a living.

684
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:12,488
This isn't like that.

685
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,522
Isn't it?

686
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,825
No, you think
I'm vulnerable.
Not at all.

687
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:17,426
No, worse than that:
You think I'm weak,

688
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,228
And maybe, with just
the right incentive,

689
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,731
I'll turn against the
people who did this to me.

690
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,400
Well, I'm
telling you no.

691
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,869
So whoever the hell it
is you're working for--

692
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,005
The syrians, the israelis,
the iranians--

693
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,373
You tell them that.

694
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,009
You tell them I would
rather die in here.

695
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,010
You're not
seeing this clearly.

696
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,411
Yeah, which part
did I get wrong?

697
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,652
(indistinct broadcast over tv)

698
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,436
Meds.

699
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,142
Abby:
Carrie?

700
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:07,977
Are you all right?

701
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:09,145
I need my meds.

702
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,293
Graham:
What are we going
to do with you?

703
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,332
I can't stay here.

704
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,368
Of course you can.

705
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,238
It's like the hole in iraq.

706
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,074
I can't do it again.

707
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:41,143
Well, I'm sure
you'll find a way.

708
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,086
Everywhere you go,

709
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,589
Other people die,

710
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:56,926
But you always
manage to survive.

711
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,261
Have you noticed that?

712
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,599
You're like a cockroach,

713
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:09,605
Still there after the last
nuclear bombs go off.

714
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,682
You belong here.

715
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,419
Am I right?

716
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,923
(sighs)

717
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,214
Come on.

718
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,819
(lock clicking)

719
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,901


720
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,251
(grunting)

721
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,257
(panting)

722
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,022


723
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:38,554
