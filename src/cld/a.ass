1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,840
酒来了
Here we go.

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,990
宝贝儿  亚当  出来跟我玩啊
Baby, Adam, come out and play with me.

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,290
该死
Oh, shit.

4
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,740
我可没想到会这样
I did not see that coming.

5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,430
汉娜
Hannah.

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,570
去叫出租车  去叫车
Get a cab, get a cab.

7
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,440
你还好吗  别别别  她在干嘛
You okay? No, no, no, no. What's she doing?

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,170
-你在干嘛  -你家住哪里
- What are you doing? - Where do you live?

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,500
你要去哪里  汉娜
Where do you need to go, Hannah?

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,360
她住在哪里  算了  我打给乌波吧
Where does she live? Okay, I'm gonna call Uber.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,770
我爸妈住在密歇根
My parents live in Michigan.

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,050
-跟没说一样  -出租车
- Great. - Taxi!

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,370
到我家了
This is it.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,870
你还好吗
Okay, you all right?

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,870
我把门关上
Let me just close the door.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,170
-好了  -我先去一下卫生间
- All right. - I just have to use the bathroom.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,170
-好的  就在...  -然后咱们就可以聊天了
- Yeah, it's-- - And then we can have a conversation.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,280
好的  卫生间在那边
Okay, well, it's right over there.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,530
都吐出来吧
Get it all out.

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,470
-真抱歉  -没事的
- I'm sorry. - No, this--

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,850
我其实没那么多心事要借酒消愁
I didn't even have that much stuff to drink.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,860
是啊  但也许是你的酒量真没那么好
Yeah, but maybe your tolerance isn't as--

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,900
真糟糕
It's not good.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,270
好了  我帮你洗洗吧  好吗
Yeah, all right. Let's get you cleaned up, okay?

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,180
-咱们去...  -我一定臭死了  好尴尬啊
- Let's get-- - I must smell so bad. I'm so embarrassed.

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,840
没事的  你不臭
It's all right. You smell fine.

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,190
很好  喝下去
Okay, yeah, drink that up.

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,350
喝下去  喝吧喝吧
Drink it. Drink it, drink it.

29
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,930
抱歉抱歉
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,440
-乔  -抱歉
- Joe! - Sorry!

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,160
乔  我特别感谢你
Joe, I just wanted to thank you so much

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,730
这么照顾我
for taking such good care of me.

33
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,680
哪的话
Of course.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,350
哪的话  我对谁都这么好
Of course, I would do it for anybody.

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,850
你还要再增加些投资吗
So, are you in for a little more?

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,160
因为这对我们画廊的未来来说是一笔重要投资
Because it's an important investment in our space's future.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,970
我约的人来了
My appointment just got here.

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,960
好的  爱你  再见爸爸
Okay, love you. Bye, Daddy.

39
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,190
-玛妮  欢迎  -酥紧
- Marnie, welcome. - Soo Jin.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
-天啊  -是啊
- Oh, my gosh. - Yeah.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,500
瞧瞧这地方  真棒
Look at this space, seriously.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,710
真赞啊  隔壁就是"开幕式"
This is amazing. It's right next to Opening Ceremony.

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,710
{\an8}著名潮流品牌零售商

44
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,950
"开墓地"还差不多  他家的价格能贵死个人
Opening Cemetery. Their prices will be the death of me.

45
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,870
不好意思我们这么乱
Sorry we're in such disarray.

46
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,480
就好像
There just, like,

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,600
-一天24小时都不够用  -可不是嘛
- aren't enough hours in a day. - Are you kidding?

48
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,600
我没法同时将女人  女友
I can't be a woman and a girlfriend

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,290
画廊主和电子音乐人
and a gallerist and an electronic musician

50
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,590
这些身份兼于一身
and all these things at once.

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,190
对一个人来说太累了  我喜欢你的帽子
It's too much for one person. I love your beanie.

52
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,750
我完全理解  我无法想象这一切
Listen, I get it. I didn't even know all of those things

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,070
都压在你一个人肩上
could be in one person.

54
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,070
-关于帽子  谢谢  -是啊
- That's-- thank you. - Yeah.

55
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,790
我能理解
Um, I just understand--

56
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,600
主要因为我也在努力...
mainly because I'm trying to juggle--

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,760
你是不是很想找工作
So, are you really interested in a job?

58
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,890
已经聊到这个话题了吗
Oh, we're just gonna do this right now.

59
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,280
好吧
Yeah, okay, um...

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,670
我觉得在画廊创建伊始
I find the idea of being part

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,890
能够加入进来非常令人激动
of the start of a gallery just so exciting--

62
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,190
构建可行的存档系统啊
finding an archiving system that works,

63
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,790
建立网上页面什么的
establishing a web presence.

64
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,300
没错  都要做的
Totally, all of that.

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,770
我一直在说  我所需要的
I've been saying all along that what I really need

66
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,190
是一个比我更有能力的助理
is an assistant who's more qualified than I am.

67
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,800
助理
Assistant?

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,750
职位不是很高
I mean, it's a really small staff.

69
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,480
但我最好的基友杰瑞米已经是画廊总监了
My best homo friend Jeremy is already gallery director,

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,160
所以我想你可以先从助理做起
so, yeah, I thought you'd start off as an assistant--

71
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,990
我的助理
my assistant.

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,520
-你多大了  -二十四岁  姐们儿
- How old are you? - Two-four, girl.

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
但为了推广画廊
But for the cred and intrigue of the gallery,

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,420
我对外都说我只有22
I'm gonna tell people I'm 22.

75
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,740
你要加入吗
So, are you with me?

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,500
亚当
Adam!

77
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,170
-亚当  真抱歉  -你他妈去哪了
- Adam, I'm so sorry. - Where the fuck were you?

78
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,500
真的真的对不起
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
怎么了
What happened?

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,430
我喝多了  在同事家里
I got so drunk and had to fall asleep

81
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,790
睡着了
at my friend from work's place.

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,510
真是太不负责了  我从来没有这样过
It was so irresponsible. I haven't acted that way, like, ever.

83
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,380
你跟你的同事们玩的开心吗
Well, did you have fun with your work friends?

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,890
我说我吐了  你担心我吗
I mean, I barfed. Were you worried about me?

85
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,300
比如我睡在乔的家里
Like, I slept at Joe's house.

86
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,480
他是我的同事
He's a guy from my work who's,

87
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,340
而且他是男的
you know, a guy.

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,000
你觉得这领子怎么放  要不要竖着
What do you think about this, up or down?

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,390
裤子不是的  这是排练的衣服
I mean not the bottom part, obviously. It's rehearsal clothes.

90
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,150
但是这件大衣
But this is the coat that

91
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,770
是我正式演出的时候要穿的
I'm actually gonna wear during the show.

92
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,970
他们说我可以带回家来
They said I could take it home

93
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,650
花几周时间把它穿穿合身
and break it in for a couple weeks,

94
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,040
所以我会在家干些我平时干的事
so I'm just gonna be doing stuff I normally do around the house

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,310
比如理理我的报纸
like organizing my newspapers

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,990
还有吃吃蛋糕  上上厕所
and eating muffins and going to the bathroom,

97
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,280
我得穿着这大衣干活
I'm just gonna be doing it in a coat.

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,330
所以  你觉得领子竖着好还是放下好
So, you think up or down looks better?

99
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,720
放下
Down.

100
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,010
好  我也这么觉得
Okay, that's what I thought, too.

101
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,040
我为你洗得很白白
I got so clean for you.

102
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,530
那手感一定不错
Oh, that must feel nice.

103
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,100
我昨晚非常难受
I was very sick last night.

104
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,070
-过来  -我能走路都是个奇迹
- Come here. - It's a miracle I'm walking.

105
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,430
过来  傻瓜
Come here, silly.

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,760
过来  过来  过来
Come here, come here, come here.

107
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,310
你闻起来的确洗白白了
Ooh, you do smell clean.

108
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,740
跟你说了  我洗得很干净
I told you, I'm very clean.

109
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,250
-我爱你 -我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

110
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,770
我爱你
I love you.

111
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,280
怎么了
What?

112
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,650
排练之前我不想出汗搞得粘乎乎的
I don't want to get sticky before rehearsal.

113
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,440
你开玩笑呢吧
Are you serious?

114
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,860
我半个小时之后就要出门
Yeah, I have to leave in a half an hour.

115
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,910
我又没有打算做什么奇怪的事情
Well, I wasn't planning anything that fucking complicated.

116
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,330
-我还是爱你的  -我也还爱你
- I still love you. - I still love you.

117
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,190
没什么大不了的  别放心上
It's not a big deal. Whatever.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
你还来看我排练吗
You still coming to rehearsal?

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,890
当然啦  当然去
Yeah, of course. Of course, of course.

120
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,680
我得...  我得去穿衣服了
I have to-- I have to go get dressed.

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,160
-好的  -我当然要去看排练
- All right. - I'm obviously coming to rehearsal.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,530
刚看到哪儿了
Now I lost my spot.

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,250
很好听
No, it's good.

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,630
有歌词吗
Got any lyrics?

125
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,640
有些什么想法
Anything you've been working on?

126
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,960
我有一本日记
Yeah, I have this journal

127
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,290
在上面写写小主意和感想
where I just write little, like, ideas and thoughts down.

128
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,180
-拿来给我看看
- Oh, here, let me see that.

129
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,160
你的内心有黑暗面
Fuck, you got some darkness in you.

130
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,620
很多黑暗面都是我吃了安眠药才写出来的
A lot of that is stuff I wrote on Ambien.

131
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,040
算了  这个实在是...
Actually, you know what? This is really--

132
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,790
不不  实际上这非常好
No, no, this is actually really cool.

133
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,710
写得非常的美
This is actually really beautiful.

134
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,050
我觉得这和曲子一定绝配
This could really work perfectly, I think.

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,760
*现在的我无话可说*
*There's nothing I can say now*

136
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,170
*我们经历了这一切*
*We've been through this before*

137
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,050
听起来还不赖
That's actually not bad.

138
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,780
真的很美  你写词有天赋
This is really beautiful. You have a gift for this.

139
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,820
你是个文人
You're-- you're a wordsmith.

140
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,450
你肯定搞错了
Now I'm sure that's wrong.

141
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,870
没有错
No, it's not wrong.

142
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,020
你要多给自己点信心
You just need to believe in yourself a little bit.

143
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,700
好了
All right, you know what?

144
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,810
我们来试试看
We're gonna do something.

145
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,880
我来弹  你来唱
I'm gonna play and you just sing.

146
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,370
想到什么就唱什么
Sing whatever comes to you.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
-就...  -走起
- Just-- - Go.

148
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,500
*游泳池和罐头*
*Swimming pools and can*

149
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,760
不  要用唱的  玛妮  唱出来
No, sing, Marnie. Come on, sing.

150
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,800
好
Okay.

151
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,260
*我在山上看见你*
*I see you on the mountains*

152
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,370
*我们乘着喷气飞机翱翔*
*We're flying on a jet plane*

153
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,530
*花朵绽放在阁楼上*
*There's flowers in the attic*

154
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,380
对了
Yes.

155
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,480
*可我还没遇见汤姆*
*But I haven't met Tom yet*

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,510
汤姆是谁
Who's Tom?

157
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,970
我不知道  我就是在瞎编
I don't know, I'm just making things up.

158
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,020
我从没说过喷气飞机这个词
I've never said the word "jet plane" before.

159
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,590
我弱爆了  我都要认不清自己了
I'm terrible at this. I can't even think of a real person I know.

160
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,670
快停  停下来
Stop that. Stop already.

161
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,710
这样吧  我来唱
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

162
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,990
你就知道什么叫糟糕了
You're gonna see what bad actually sounds like.

163
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,760
*我现在就想要你*
*I need you in my bed now*

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,660
*你在我脑海里挥之不去*
*Can't get you off of my mind*

165
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,610
*我将饥渴而死  姑娘*
*I'm dying of this thirst, girl*

166
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,160
*这无尽的饥渴  姑娘*
*This thirsty thirsty thirst, girl*

167
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,540
这首歌讲什么的
What were you singing this song about?

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,990
我女友  克莱蒙泰
My girlfriend, Clementine.

169
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,380
她总是出差
She's gotta travel a lot for work.

170
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,560
我真的很想她
I really miss her.

171
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,990
那当然了
Yeah, I bet.

172
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,120
惨到家了
It's the worst.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,370
你应该知道非鲁伯特·默多克名下的报纸
You do realize Rupert Murdoch owns

174
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,850
也都是他的
even newspapers he doesn't own.

175
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,460
他就像报业教父
He's like the Godfather of it all,

176
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,690
我们看到的这些消息
and none of the information we read

177
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,910
根本不能做出一丁点客观的评价
can even make a mild claim to objectivity.

178
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,460
-我想要办我自己的报纸  -是吗
- I'd like to start my own newspaper. - You would?

179
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,380
-一份时不时能说真话的报纸  -好
- One that told the truth once in a while, you know? - Yeah.

180
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,970
-写写街坊邻居的新鲜事  -没错
- Just what was up around the neighborhood. - Yeah, neighborhood.

181
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,900
比方说谁死了  谁开始种花了之类的
You know, who died, who started a garden, you know?

182
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,330
不刊登照片
And there will be no photographs,

183
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,860
-只用素描  -只用素描
- only drawings. - Only drawings.

184
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,710
-就叫它《每日真理报》  -没错
- And it would be called "The Daily Truth." - Yeah!

185
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,530
-是不是很棒  -是啊
- Isn't that fantastic? - Yeah!

186
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,630
-太棒了  -索姗娜
- Yeah. - Shoshanna!

187
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,020
索...  姗娜
Sho-shanna!

188
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,180
-你好  我们就想跟你打个招呼  -你好
- Hi, hi. We just wanted to say hi. - Hi.

189
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,070
我得去看那个人的马了
Gotta see a man about a horse, okay.

190
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,360
我去把门顶开  这样就能出去忙了
I'll wedge the door open so I can buzz myself.

191
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,110
妈的
Fuck my cunt.

192
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,240
天呐  多可悲的男人啊
Jesus, what a sad, sad man.

193
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
身边一个人都没有
He has no one.

194
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,480
他前妻改嫁给一个大律师
His ex-wife remarried a barrister.

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,640
他女儿就住在纽约
His daughter lives right here in New York,

196
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,550
但他不敢找她
but he's too scared to even call her.

197
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,340
他以前是非常成功的酒店经理
He used to be a very successful hotelier.

198
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,160
现在他除了一盒子拖鞋一无所有
Now all he has to show for it is a box full of slippers.

199
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,570
别告诉他我又吸了
Don't tell him I have this, okay?

200
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,390
就这  进去吧
There's your way. In you go.

201
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,220
小心点  朋友
Whoa, easy there, mate.

202
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,230
她不会伤害你的
She ain't doing you no harm.

203
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,050
你叫谁朋友呢
Who you calling mate?

204
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,040
你想为她挺身而出  是不是
You wanna stand up for her, do ya?

205
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,720
举起手来
Put up your hands.

206
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,460
-你是谁  -我
- Who are you? - Me?

207
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,520
我是亚当的女友
Oh, I'm Adam's girlfriend.

208
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,700
-谁  -亚当的女友
- Who? - I'm Adam's girlfriend.

209
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,860
你来干什么
Why are you here?

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,390
来看你们彩排
I'm here just to check out rehearsal.

211
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,110
不行  这不欢迎陌生人  抱歉
No, we can't have anybody watching rehearsals. I'm sorry.

212
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,770
亚当跟我提过
Okay, well, Adam mentioned

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,170
说我能来看看是好事
that it would be good for me to stop by.

214
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,580
没错  有这种可能性而已  汉娜
Yeah, I mean, we talked about this being a possibility, Hannah.

215
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,110
你知道我正在工作
You know, I'm at work and, you know...

216
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,920
好吧
O-okay. Okay. All right.

217
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,990
{\an8}《巴巴拉少校》

218
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,330
那些所谓浪漫  秘密  兴奋感
That romance, that mystery, that thrill--

219
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,450
-都会随风而逝  -没错
- That goes. - I gotcha.

220
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,880
你知道还能怎么样吗
And you know what you're left with?

221
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,720
在他想让你离开时还要试着勾引他
Trying to seduce him when he just wants you to leave

222
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,470
然后他们就能打着飞机坐着公车去彩排
so they can jerk off and take the bus to rehearsal.

223
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,520
就是  坐公车
The bus.

224
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,470
我们现在的性生活没有一点惊喜和兴奋
There's nothing weird or exciting about our sexual life anymore.

225
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,660
他就当我是带性器的搁脚凳
He's treating me like an ottoman with a vagina.

226
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,550
你说的真恶心
That's a disgusting image.

227
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,910
我和帕尔要结束的时候
At the end of my relationship with Pal,

228
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,240
我以为他只是对我的身体失去了兴趣
I thought he had just totally lost interest in my body.

229
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,810
真的吗
Are you serious?

230
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,580
他对我只是例行公事
I was just, like, part of his routine.

231
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,910
那你一定超难受  对吧
And that made you feel fucking terrible, right?

232
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,720
对  还很困惑  因为我比他
Yeah, and also confused because I'm so much more

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
有魅力多了
traditionally attractive than he is.

234
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,720
亚当的问题在于
The thing about Adam is, like,

235
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,630
他是我认识的最好的人之一
he's one of the best people I've ever known.

236
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
-是吗  -是
- Is he? - Yeah.

237
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,070
好吧  我跟他没那么熟
Okay. I don't really know him that well.

238
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,840
很难了解他  不过一旦你了解他
He's hard to get to know, but once you do get to know him,

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,060
就根本没法想象没有他的生活
you can't imagine your life without him,

240
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,200
所以我知道我需要做点什么
and so I just know I need to do something that's gonna

241
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,370
好让他想起来
make him remember

242
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,030
为什么我俩是相爱的
why we love each other.

243
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,220
如果这是你想要的  那就去争取吧
You should fight for it, if this is what you want.

244
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,090
我受够跟他谈心了
I'm just so sick of talking.

245
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,680
那就做点什么
Well, then, go do something.

246
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,010
我彩排中场休息了
Yo, on a quick break.

247
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,120
就问问你需要我买晚饭带回来吗
I was wondering if you wanted me to pick up dinner.

248
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,220
知道吗  其实我刚准备了个小计划
You know what? I actually already made a plan for us.

249
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,260
九点的时候你到环球酒吧找我吧
Why don't you just meet me at the Globe at 9:00?

250
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,170
那里有什么吃的
What kind of food do they serve?

251
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,930
不是要吃饭  你吃了再来  好吗
It's not really a food plan, so eat first, okay?

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,470
-好吧  我得挂了  -好  我爱你  再见
- Okay. I gotta go. - Okay, I love you, bye.

253
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,920
我是玛妮  有事请留言
Yo, it's Marnie. Leave me a message.

254
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,750
玛妮  是我  问个奇怪的问题
Hey, Marn, it's me. Weird question--

255
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,170
能借你公寓一用吗
can I borrow your apartment for something?

256
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,450
拜托马上给我回电
Please call me back immediately.

257
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,510
谢谢
Thank you.

258
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,260
为什么来这儿
Why are we here?

259
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,280
索姗娜要请咱俩吃牛排
Shoshanna's gonna buy us a steak.

260
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,880
我要像喂小鸟一样喂你
I'm gonna feed it to you like a baby bird.

261
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,730
你说过牛排已经上来了
You said the meat would be waiting.

262
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,180
是啊  你说过
Yeah, you said that.

263
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,440
好吧  其实和吃的无关
Okay, so this isn't actually about food.

264
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,220
会有吃的  但是我们不聊吃的
There can be food, but it's not about food.

265
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,210
爸
Daddy?

266
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,980
多蒂
Dottie?

267
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,210
惊喜
Surprise!

268
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,950
你好啊
Hello.

269
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,220
-你好  我是多蒂  -你他妈搞毛啊
- Hi, I'm Dot. - What the fuck is wrong with you?

270
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,070
你要知道这不是个好主意
You know this is not a good idea.

271
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,970
-你是怎么找到我的  -是我找到她的
- How did you find me? - I found her.

272
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,700
我让她过来  你需要帮助
I told her to come. You need help.

273
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,190
-祝福你  -我现在可不要被你传染生病
- Bless you. - I can't afford to get ill right now.

274

我们还要攒钱旅行  告辞了
We have travel plans. We're leaving.

275
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,170
不不不  别走  别别别
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.

276
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,640
不是传染病  只是过敏而已
I'm not contagious. My allergies are just acting up.

277
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,580
看她的牛皮癣  看  是压力引起的
So is her psoriasis. Look, it's stress-related.

278
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,760
我看着你呢爸  我之前也见过这表情
I'm looking at you, Dad, and I've seen this before.

279
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,440
你的眼睛就像个小小的老鼠洞
Your eyes look like tiny mouse holes.

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,240
她有多大呀  爸
How old is she, Dad?

281
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,210
我希望她至少能比我大半年吧
I'd love to know she has at least six months on me.

282
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,870
拜托别他妈像我
Please don't talk about me

283
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,980
-别生气  别生气  -不在这儿一样议论我
- Please, please, please. -  like I'm not even fucking here.

284

我已经四十七了
I am 47 years old.

285
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,800
好歹尊重点我吧
I deserve a little more respect.

286
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,160
她还挺搞笑的
She's hilarious as well.

287
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,910
看见了吧  明白我对你做了什么吧
See? See what this does? What I do to you?

288
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,940
这就是我做的  所以你不能跟我一起
This is what I do to you, which is why you can't be around me.

289
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,610
-你必须离开  -这借口糟透了
- You have to go. - That is the worst excuse in the world.

290
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,940
我早该知道  从六岁起你就不时用这个借口
I should know, you've been using it on and off since I was six.

291
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,490
什么也没发生  什么也没发生
This is not happening to me. This is not happening to me.

292
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,100
燥热的夜晚
Hot night.

293
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,980
这座城的盛夏
Summer in the city.

294
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,910
我能坐过去吗
May I join you?

295
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,950
搞什么
The fuck?

296
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,200
我能坐过去吗
May I join you?

297
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,780

Sure.

298
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,110
抱歉  我觉得有点不自在
I'm sorry, I feel a bit unlike myself.

299
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,260
我的老公  玛凡尼尔  还在加班
My husband, Marfaniel, was stuck at work.

300
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,550
似乎这些天他总是加班
He's always stuck at work, it seems, these days,

301
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,090
这儿有一杯我为他点的伏特加
and here I am with the vodka I ordered for him.

302
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,820
你想喝吗
Would you like it?

303
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,960
不用了
No.

304
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,410
谢谢  我不喝酒
Thank you. I don't drink.

305

亚当  这是水
Adam, it's water.

306
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,560
我不想每一部分都得解释
I don't want to have to explain every part of it.

307
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,680
你想喝加丹尼尔的酒吗
Would you like Jardaniel's drink?

308

是的
Oh, yes.

309
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,270
有吸管吗
Is there a straw?

310
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,030
能冒昧问下你对哪种女人感兴趣吗
May I be so bold as to ask what sorts of women interest you?

311
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,320
像你这样的已婚荡妇
Married sluts like you.

312
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
你疯了吗
Are you on crack?

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,960
我是个已婚的老女人

No one talks to me like that but my husband.

318
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,310
你干吗在酒吧里搞得像个荡妇似的
Why are you in a bar acting like a little slut?

319

荡妇吗  清醒点吧
Slut? Get real.

320

出什么事了  你还好吧
What's going on? Are you all right?

325

-不  -不不  这是我...

327
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,510
我这辈子从没见过这个人
I have never seen this guy in my entire life.

328
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,970
我们闹着玩的  她是我女友
We're fucking around and this is my girlfriend.

329

I don't know him. I'm freaking out.

332
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,880
讲真的  你要是还骚扰这位女士
I'm gonna call the cops, seriously,

333
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,890
我就要叫警察了
if you don't leave the lady alone.

伤着你的大脑门了吗
Did it hurt your big old head?

350

支持啦  还有关爱啦
and all the support and love he can get

352
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,750
让他重新找到自我
so he can become himself again.

353
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,760
我挺自我的
I am myself.

你干吗不告诉我你在城里
Why didn't you tell me you were in the city?

360
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,330
因为他是个无业游民
Because he's a bum.

361
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,560
他亲口跟你说的

目前是的  但你绝对想不到
Right now he is, but you can't imagine

不  她想的  非常非常想
No, she does. She really, really does.

376
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,860
她很十分非常想你  她亲口跟我说的
She misses you so, so much. She told me so herself.

377
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,720
你他妈有病吧  索姗娜
What the fuck is wrong with you, Shoshanna?

378
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,570
别大喊大叫
Don't shout, don't shout.

379
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,840

Nothing's fucking wrong with me. What's wrong with you?

这真是一如既往的糟透了
This is hopeless, as usual.

388

感谢你的操蛋时间
Thank you for your fucking time.

389

整整两个月全然不知你的行踪
not having a clue where you are for the last two months?

401
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,730
他就是个彻头彻尾的混账

No, we can't get rid of her.

408
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,940
-她会没事的  -我不能甩掉洁莎
- She'll be fine. - I can't get rid of Jessa.

409
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,010
-不  你可以  -我不行
- Yes, you can. - No, I can't.

410
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,570
-你可以的  -不  我爱她
- Yes, you can. - No, I love her.

411
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,850
-索姗娜会照顾洁莎的  -你会吗
- Shoshanna's gonna look after Jessa. - Are you?

412
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,620
我不介意吸毒的人
I don't mind drug addicts.

413
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,280
我有各种各样的朋友
I have all sorts of friends,

414
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,300
但她  爸爸  她看起来不像好姑娘
but she just-- daddy, she doesn't seem like a very nice girl.

415
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,830
不  她是个非常好的姑娘
Oh, no, she's a very nice girl.

416
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,960
好吧  但愿她能找到人帮她
Well-- well, I hope she can find the help she needs.

417
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,300
操
Fuck.

418
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,460
对于对冲基金经理的老婆来说  这里太寒酸了
This is quite a shithole for a hedge fund manager's wife.

419
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,820
我丈夫就让我住在这里
Well, it's just where my husband puts me up.

420
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,560
这是他的暂住地
It's his pied-de-terre.

421
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,670
这是谁家
Whose apartment is this?

422
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,640
我说了  这是我丈夫的暂住...
I told you, it's my husband's pied--

423
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,210
汉娜  这是玛妮家对不对
No, Hannah, this is Marnie's, right?

424
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,230
闻着就像玛妮家
Smells like Marnie's.

425
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,720
全是饼干和空气清新剂的味道
Smells like cookies and air freshener.

426
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,760
谁是玛妮  你觉得我在
Who's Marnie? You think I want to hear

427
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,980
被你强迫拽来这里之后  还会想
about your former flames at a time like this

428
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,040
听到你提起自己的旧情人吗
when you've dragged me here against my goddamn will?

429
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,890
我说过了  我丈夫就让我住这里
I told you, this is where my husband puts me.

430
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,830
他非常关心我
He worries about me, a lot.

431
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,700
给我留下了些东西以防万一
So he left some stuff for me so I wouldn't get into trouble.

432
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,190
有草莓  香槟  一根已经被我用太多次
Strawberries, champagne, a dildo,

433
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,630
磨烂了的假鸡巴
which I already destroyed through overuse.

434
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,320
他怕我住得无聊  出去惹麻烦
He was scared I'd get bored and go out lookin' for trouble.

435
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,560
我果然无聊了  也惹上了麻烦
And I did get bored. And I did get into trouble.

436
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,000
现在我发现自己一团糟
And now I find myself in quite a pickle.

437
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,330
你有刀吗
Do you have a knife?

438
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,880
像这种刀吗
You mean a knife like this?

439
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,570
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

440
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,160
别废话了  你想把我怎么样
Now cut to the chase. What are you gonna do to me?

441
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,770
-把衣服脱掉  -不
- Show me what's under your clothes. - No.

442
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,380
休想
Not now, not ever.

443
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,200
别逼我这么做  下面只是内衣而已
Don't force me to do this. It's just my underpants.

444
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,100
我勒个擦  你像棵圣诞树
Jesus fucking Christ. You look like a Christmas tree.

445
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,770
-裙子也脱掉  -这样给你
- Skirt, too. - It's humiliating...

446
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,010
看我的内衣  真是丢脸
to show off my house underwear like this.

447
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,890
你太过分了
You're so demanding.

448
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,670
爬上床
Crawl on the bed.

449
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,760
你想让我吃掉这些东西吗
Do you want me to eat all the foods?

450
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,900
吃一颗草莓
Put a berry in your mouth.

451
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,580
整个吞下去  别就咬一口
Swallow it whole. You can't just have part.

452
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,700
我怕吃到叶子了
I'm afraid to eat the green part.

453
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,290
整个吞下去  别就咬一口
Swallow it whole. You can't just have part.

454
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,900
我做不到
Very hard to do.

455
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,600
不
No.

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,040
我发过誓不会这么做的
That's the thing I swore would never happen.

457
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,060
从现在起  你别想浅尝辄止
From now on, the rule is you can't just have part.

458
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,040
要么一口吞下  要么别想碰
You have to take the whole thing or nothing.

459
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,790
你现在他妈的开心了吧
I sure as hell hope you're happy.

460
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,380
你看起来像个毒虫
You look like a junkie.

461
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,660
我就是个毒虫
I am a junkie.

462
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,350
我一般都睡橄榄球员
I usually fuck football players,

463
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,540
现在却和校园怪胎在上床
but now I'm fucking the school weirdo.

464
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,700
校园怪胎吗
The school weirdo?

465
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,770
我是啦啦队长
And I'm a cheerleader and

466
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,670
你以前总是幻想要操我
you thought so much about fucking me before.

467
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,480
我以为你是对冲基金经理的老婆
I thought you were a hedge fund manager's wife.

468
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,770
不不  我叫金
No, no, I'm Kim,

469
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,200
一般都睡橄榄球员
and I usually fuck football players,

470
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,560
但结果发现校园怪胎的鸡巴
but it turns out the school weirdo has an even bigger dick

471
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,710
比橄榄球员还大  你个怪胎
than a football player, you fucking weirdo.

472
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,960
我才不是什么怪胎
I'm not the fucking school weirdo.

473
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,120
什么
What?

474
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,880
你别演到一半就换角色好吗
You can't change roles in the middle of everything.

475
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,140
根本就不合理啊
It doesn't make any fucking narrative sense.

476
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,960
好吧  你现在有戏演了
Okay, so now that you're in a play,

477
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,470
合理不合理就得听你的了是吧
you're, like, the expert on what makes narrative sense?

478
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,730
-汉娜  到底要怎样  -我也是作家
- Hannah, what the fuck? - I'm a writer, too, you know.

479
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,480
干什么
What?

480
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,910
我只是想要尝试你喜欢的
I was trying to do something you'd like,

481
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,810
就像我们以前做爱那样
like have sex the way that we used to.

482
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,410
你为什么这么不爽
Why are you getting so mad at me?

483
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,600
什么是  我们以前做爱那样
What do you mean, "the way we used to"?

484
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,160
你不喜欢现在这样吗
You don't like the way we do it now?

485
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,840
你喜欢吗
I mean, do you?

486
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,000
你以前对我有各种各样的创意
You used to have all these ideas about me

487
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,290
像是街头小荡妇
being, like, a little street slut

488
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,300
或者是带病的孤儿
or, like, an orphan with a disease

489
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,640
你还会说我是婴儿身体里的女人什么的
or you said I was, like, a woman with a baby's body or something.

490
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,380
我只是想要像以前那样
I was just trying to do it the way that we used to,

491
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,980
以前都是那样做爱的
the way that sex always was for us.

492
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,530
根本不是这样精心安排又很诡异
It wasn't all creepy and thought through like this.

493
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,280
是在某一瞬间我们就陷进去了
It was just coming to us in the moment.

494
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,730
我没有那种的创意
I don't have ideas like that.

495
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,630
我只是在模仿你的创意
I was just doing your ideas.

496
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,070
想要像你一样去做爱
I was just doing sex the way you wanted to.

497
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,030
天呐  汉娜  无语了
Jesus, Hannah, fuck.

498
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,120
感觉来了  我根本就不知道我在说什么
The second I come, I have no fucking idea what I said.

499
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,370
我没在安排
I'm not planning anything.

500
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,720
但是你根本不是你
But you were outside yourself.

501
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,690
你已经脱离了你自己  看着一切
You were outside your body watching everything.

502
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,720
所以呢
So?

503
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,070
那又怎么样
What does it matter?

504
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,950
如果你得到你想要的感觉
If you're getting what you want,

505
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,200
你为什么还要在意我在不在身体里
what do you care if I'm, like, in my body?

506
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,290
你又不是什么身体警察
You can't be, like, the body police.

507
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,710
你对我的认识还停留在以前
You have an old idea of who I am.

508
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,830
性爱可以让我不想着去酗酒
Sex was the thing that kept me from drinking.

509
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,140
所以我才在酒吧之类的地方找女人
That's why I fucked women I met in bars or whatever.

510
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,330
你对她们也是这样吗
Was it like that with all of them?

511
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,090
游戏啊  创意啊  与众不同什么的吗
Like, the games and the ideas and the being different?

512
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,470
对  以前是这样
Fuck, yeah. Yes, it was.

513
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,110
我们俩也曾经这样过一段时间
And it was with us for a while, too.

514
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,880
但之后我们就相爱了
But then we fell in love,

515
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,620
之后我只想跟你有我们自己的性爱
and then I just wanted to have sex with just you as us.

516
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,920
甜蜜纯粹的性爱而已
Just fuck and be sweet or whatever.

517
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,300
如果我们现在的方式
If the sex we were having

518
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,580
让你不开心了  我真的很抱歉
wasn't working for you, I'm fucking sorry.

519
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,490
我不知道我让你这么失望了
I didn't realize I was disappointing you so badly.

520
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,720
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

521
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
-不是吗  -不是的
- Was it not? - No.

522
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,610
你以为我是愤怒的反社会者
You think I'm some angry fucking sociopath

523
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,010
就想要找那种酒吧里的老女人
who wants to meet older women in bars

524
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,390
然后激怒她们来做爱吗
and intimidate them into fucking me?

525
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,940
我的确可以  但是我现在有工作了
Because I can do that, but I have a job to do now,

526
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,910
我要努力专注于工作
and I'm trying to focus,

527
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,260
不是闲着没事跟你玩角色扮演
and I'm not here to fill up your life with fucking stories

528
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,100
就为了你能写推特
for your fucking Twitter.

529
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,360
我懂了  我也有工作啊
I get it. I have a job, too.

530
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,210
根本不一样
It's not the same thing.

531
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,610
真的吗  你疯了吗
Really? That's crazy.

532
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,550
我不想吵了  我需要集中精神
I can't do this. I have to focus.

533
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,420
雷说我可以去他那里住一段时间
Ray said I could stay with him for a while.

534
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,750
等等  什么
Wait, what?

535
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,360
你要住在雷那里一段时间
You're gonna go stay with Ray for a while?

536
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,670
只是彩排阶段
Just through the rehearsal process

537
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,880
我就能好好集中精神在戏里
so I can just think about the play

538
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,030
而不是来跟你瞎折腾
and not have to deal with all this drama.

539
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,160
什么瞎折腾  只是我而已啊
What drama? This is just me.

540
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,150
就是说
Exactly.

541
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,380
我不懂了  你一开始根本就不在乎那剧
I don't get it. You didn't even care about the play.

542
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,160
但是实际上
Well, but here's the thing.

543
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,050
我在意  一直很在意
I did. I always did. I do.

544
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,720
而且我非常开心终于可以在意一些事情了
It feels amazing to finally care about something.

545
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,620
感觉特棒又特吓人  但如果我没有
It feels amazing and scary, and I'll always regret it

546
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,000
拼尽全力去尝试  我一定会非常遗憾的
if I don't give myself a chance to just do it all the way.

547
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,000
你听起来就像在演《梦幻成真》
You sound like you're in, like, "Field of Dreams."

548
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,320
这不是在开玩笑
Well, it-- it's not a joke to me.

549
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,790
我也没开玩笑
I didn't say it was.

550
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,020
很抱歉  但是我得走了
I'm sorry, I have to go.

551
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,530
汉娜  放开
Hannah, fuck.
