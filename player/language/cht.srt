他也應該對我們講點義氣

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,940
我會跟他說的

Smells pretty good.

-需要我幫忙嗎  -你可以...
- How can I help you? - Well, you can, uh...

51
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,230
把袋子里的東西切了

- Not happening. - You don't like cilantro?

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,720

Look. Come here, trust me.

59
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,070
嘗嘗
Try this.

60
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,920

味道好極了
That's amazing.

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,370
你從哪學來這么棒的廚藝
Where did you learn to cook like this?

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,000
我爸爸去世后
Well, after my dad died,

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
我的一位叔叔...
I had this uncle who...

65
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,530
教了我幾個菜的做法
taught me how to make some dishes

66
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,020
好讓我照顧奶奶
so I could help out my grandma.

67
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,680
我不知道你爸爸去世了
I didn't know that your dad died.

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,570
是啊
Yeah.

69
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,590
我那年10歲
I was ten.

70
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,580
有一天放學后
Uh... I was waiting for him to pick me up

71
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,340
等他來學校接我  而他...
one day from school, and he...

72
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,910
沒有來
didn't show up.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,860
我很抱歉  我不知情
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

74
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,090
沒關系的
No, that's okay.

75
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,150
有段時間很艱難
It was rough for a while,

76
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,350
但我和奶奶很幸運
but Grandma and I were lucky.

77
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,580
我們住在一個溫暖的街區
We lived in a very tight-knit community.

78
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,600
什么意思
What do you mean?

79
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,140
我們有街坊相助
We had these neighbors.

80
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,920
他們很照顧我們
They... looked out for us.

81
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,160
特別是照顧我
They looked out for me, in particular.

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,950
你還跟他們有聯系嗎
Do you still see them?

83
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,980
-沒有了  -為什么
- No. - How come?

84
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,860
我先是參軍
Uh... joined the Army,

85
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,780
后來當警察
LAPD...

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
所以就慢慢
Just kind of, uh...

87
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,150
失去聯系了
lost touch, I guess.

88
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,630
但我很想他們
I miss them, though.

89
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,740
我能理解
Yeah, I can imagine.

90
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,610
但我很高興他們當時幫了你
But I'm glad they were there when you needed them.

91
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,520
是啊
Yeah.

92
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,040
我完全理解
I totally understand.

93
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,340
我知道我給警察帶來很多麻煩
You know, I know I dish a lot of crap about cops

94
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,710
但我爸爸外出執行任務的那些夜晚
but... all the nights my dad was out working late,

95
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,080
總有他們部門的人
there was always somebody from his department

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,240
過來看我們
coming and checking on us,

97
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,710
確保我們沒事
making sure that we were okay.

98
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,320
也許這就是你當警察的原因
Maybe that's why you became a cop.

99
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,880
為了去看你嗎
Oh, to check in on you?

100
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,060
繼續攪  別燒糊了
Keep stirring. Don't let it burn. 

101
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,980
不是  因為你會找到一個家
No. So that you could find a family.

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,780
是啊
Yeah.

103
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,110
我根本沒想到
You know, I never realized

104
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,070
反黑組像一個大家庭
how much the GTF would feel like home.

105
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,730
我真的很喜歡他們
I really like those guys, you know?

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,030
很喜歡
A lot.

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,900
而且...
And, uh...

108
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,780
你自己也不錯  美人
you're not too bad yourself, sexy.

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,030
不會糊了吧
Mmm. It's not gonna burn, right?

110
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,630
不會  我把火關了
No, I turned the burners off.

111
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,090
沒問題的
It's all good.

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,450
別接啊
No, don't.

113
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,230
等會兒接  等會兒接
It can wait, it can wait.

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,470
我感覺你父親在對我們進行監視
I'm starting to think your father has us under surveillance.

115
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,170
我不會感到驚訝的
I wouldn't put it past him.

116
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,550
-什么情況  -不知道
- What's the word? - I don't know.

117
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,390
隊長什么都沒說
Captain's keeping it close to his vest.

118
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,050
你噴古龍水了嗎
Hey, is that cologne?

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,680
洛佩茲交桃花運了
Lopez gettin' lucky!

120
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,740
這妞兒是誰啊
Who's the lucky lady, huh?

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,280
我可能知道是誰
I think I know who she is.

122
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,210
等等
Wait...

123
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,160
別告訴我是證物科的特里薩
don't tell me it's Theresa from Evidence.

124
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,910
哥們  這妞搞過的警察數都數不過來
Dude, that girl's serviced more cops than a donut shop.

125
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,820
不是吧  特里薩嗎
Ooh. No way. Theresa?

126
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,890
該死的  泰
Ooh, damn, Tae,

127
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,920
-我知道這是什么意思  -你也拜倒在她裙下嗎
- I know what that means. - You, too, huh?

128
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,930
晚上好  女士們
Good evening, ladies.

129
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,910
我們要去...
We're gonna...

130
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,100
誰噴古龍水了
Who's wearing cologne?

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,250
是洛佩茲啊
Ah, Lopez.

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,900
打擾你約會了吧
We interrupt a date?

133
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,990
沒有  長官
No, sir.

134
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,620
快點  給隊長好好講講你的新妞
Come on, tell the captain all about your new sweetie-pie?

135
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,210
隊長  你要告訴我們來這的目的
Cap, you gonna tell us what we're doing out here,

136
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,840
還是說大家來就是為了嘲笑我的
or is everyone just gonna bust my balls tonight?

137
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,860
我們去阿拉瓦多街和西湖街岔路口的
We're moving on an auto shop

138
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,090
一家汽車修配廠
at Alvarado and Westlake.

139
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,080
有線報稱那里可能是個毒品倉庫
My intel tells me it might be a stash house.

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,030
我們要找一輛白色卡車
We're looking for a white truck

141
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,920
被四個人看守
protected by four bodies.

142
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,980
還有兩個街區遠
We're two blocks out.

143
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,020
做好準備
Get ready.

144
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,110
-我們被發現了  -等等
- We've been made. - Hold on.

145
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,470
在那里  就是那輛卡車
There it is. That's the truck.

146
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,460
發現它了
We got 'em.

147
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,330
隊長  你在干什么
Captain, what are you doing?

148
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,180
大家抓穩
Everybody hang on!

149
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,460
隊長  小心
Cap, watch out!

150
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,420
別動
Don't move!

151
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,820
準備  出發
Ready? Let's go.

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,360
什么情況
What do we got?

153
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,790
可以去化驗一下  但我感覺味道像玉米餅
We could run it by the lab, but it tastes like tacos to me.

154
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,740
檢查剩余的袋子
Check the rest of the bags.

155
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,210
毒品一定藏在里面
Drugs gotta be in here somewhere.

156
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,580
肯定藏在什么地方
Must be a stash somewhere.

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,640
你們這是在浪費時間
You're all wasting your time.

158
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,330
你是說你的情報有誤嗎
You're saying your intel was off?

159
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,800
不  我是說毒品不在車里
No, I'm saying the drugs aren't in the truck,

160
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,740
就是這輛車本身
they are the truck.

161
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,130
檢查涂料
Check the paint.

162
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,420
看看那個光澤
Look at that shine.

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,170
是魚鱗
Fishscale.

164
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,740
你是說整輛車都是用可卡因包覆的嗎
You telling me this entire things is coated in cocaine?

165
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,760
幾乎無法察覺的優質魚鱗可卡因
Virtually undetectable high-grade Fishscale cocaine,

166
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,630
沒錯
that's right.

167
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,760
這是安杰利哥幫的車
It's a Los Angelicos truck.

168
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,230
沒錯
Yes, it is.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,130
看看這個
Hey, check this out.

170
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,760
他們是怎么做的
How do they even do this?

171
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,560
他們用來粉刷卡車的涂料
The paint they used to coat the truck with

172
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,070
是由水溶性聚合物和41%的可卡因混合制成的
was 41% cocaine base with a water-soluble polymer.

173
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,240
他們還在分離
They're still separating it,

174
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,600
但看來上面至少有200千克
but it looks like there's at least 200 kilos in there.

175
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,290
看起來你的情報完全正確啊  隊長
Looks like your intel was dead on, cap.

176
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,580
你的線人是誰
Who's your CI?

177
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,520
他很可靠
Well, he's solid.

178
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,160
大家知道這點就行
That's all anybody has to know.

179
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,680
泰  那個司機交待了嗎
Tae, is the driver of that truck talking yet?

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,340
一無所獲
Nothing.

181
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,260
我們在商店抓的那個家伙也沒開口
The guys we apprehended at the shop, either.

182
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,100
我們得找到點什么
Well, we have to find something,

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,570
任何能證明這些貨與阿科斯塔家有關的線索
anything to tie these drugs to Acosta.

184
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,950
你的線人不能作證嗎
Your CI can't testify?

185
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,300
一名罪犯揭發其他人的證詞
Well, one criminal's word against another

186
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,290
還不足以扳倒
won't be enough to bring down

187
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,520
安杰利哥幫的頭目
the head of the Angelicos.

188
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,110
我們得有確鑿證據使案子無懈可擊
We have to build an airtight case with concrete evidence.

189
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,570
隊長說得對
Captain's right.

190
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,740
魚鱗銷售不會停止
That Fishscale pipeline is not gonna stop

191
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,910
除非我們抓到那個負責人
unless we get to the man in charge of the flow.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
每個人都想想有沒有什么辦法
Everyone, see what you can come up

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,740
能把阿科斯塔家和咱們查獲的毒品聯系在一起
with to tie Acosta to our seizure.

194
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,700
我去聯系我的線人
I'm gonna check with my CI

195
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,460
確保咱們沒漏掉什么
and make sure we haven't missed anything.

196
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,200
需要后援嗎
Need some backup?

197
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,180
不用  我自己去就行  瑞恩
No, I'm gonna go solo on this, Ryan.

198
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,320
說不定能幫上忙呢
Might be able to help.

199
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,580
你知道我比誰都了解這些拉丁幫派
You know I know these Latin gangs better than anyone.

200
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,240
非常感謝  瑞恩
Well, I appreciate that, Ryan, 

201
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,870
但不能暴露這人的身份
but this guy is off the books.

202
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,760
而且鑒于卡特的內務部調查還在進行
And, uh, with Carter's IA investigation still active,

203
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,680
你最好
the last thing you need

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,210
別摻和這種事
is this to blow up in your face.

205
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,000
知道了
I get it.

206
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,780
永遠提防我啊  隊長
Always looking out for me, huh, cap?

207
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,590
沒錯  一直都是
That's right. Always am.

208
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,870
究竟發生了什么
What the hell happened out there?

209
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,630
你怎么沒告訴我們有輛卡車進來
Why didn't you tell us they had a truck coming in?

210
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,160
你知道我每周要收到多少貨嗎
Do you know how many shipments I get in each week?

211
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,280
查普爾盯上我們的魚鱗時  你本該警告我的
You're supposed to alert me when Chapel's onto our Fishscale.

212
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,860
我不知道  查普爾沒告訴我們
I didn't know. Chapel didn't tell us.

213
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,190
那家汽修廠甚至不在安杰利哥幫的地盤上
That shop wasn't even in Angelicos territory.

214
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,050
我沒法預料到這件事
There's no way I could've gotten ahead of this.

215
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,380
查普爾是怎么發現
How did Chapel find out

216
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,020
我們的行車路線的
which way our trucks were headed?

217
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,530
他有個線人
He has an informant.

218
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,960
梅塔斯集團的還是安杰利哥幫的
Metas or Angelicos?

219
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,050
還不確定
Not sure yet.

220
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,340
查普爾沒說
Chapel's not saying.

221
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,150
看來有很多查普爾沒說的事
Seems to be a lot Chapel's not saying right now.

222
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,110
你確定他還信任你嗎
Are you sure he still trusts you?

223
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,060
是的
Yes.

224
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,190
他信任我
He trusts me.

225
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,870
只是最近僥幸脫險的次數太多
There's just been a lot of close calls lately

226
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,120
他看你每次都能蒙混過關
and he keeps seeing you slip through each one.

227
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,420
如果查普爾不說
So how we gonna catch this snitch

228
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,690
我們要怎么抓到這個告密者
if Chapel's not talking?

229
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,740
我在處理了
I'm already on it.

230
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,360
今天之前我會有其他消息的
I'll have more news by the end of the day.

231
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,860
瑞恩  如果查普爾不再信任你
Ryan... if Chapel's not trusting you anymore,

232
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,800
我們得把麻煩都解決掉
we need to take care of our problem.

233
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,780
不能動我們隊  賈維爾
My team is off limits, Javier.

234
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,180
你們隊
Your team?

235
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,370
孩子  那你的家人怎么辦
Mijo, what about your family?

236
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,110
查普爾是我的事  好嗎  讓我來解決
Chapel's my problem, all right? Let me handle him.

237
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,380
我能處理好  我知道自己在做什么
I've got it! I know what I'm doing.

238
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,030
讓我做好我的本職工作
Let me do my job.

239
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,670
你必須得抓住這個奸細  瑞恩
You have to catch that rat, Ryan.

240
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,440
我這周還有另一批貨要來
I got another shipment coming in this week.

241
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,070
重量級的貨  有一噸
Heavy weight. A thousand keys.

242
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,670
這批貨我們可丟不起
We can't afford to lose this one.

243
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,110
-那就先運回去  -不行
- Well, then turn it back. - Look, I can't.

244
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,140
現在風頭太緊了
It's too hot right now.

245
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,280
你們查收的那200千克貨  對我們影響很大
The 200 keys you took? It's gonna cost us.

246
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,940
我能還清梅塔斯集團的唯一方法
The only way I can pay back the Metas

247
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,320
就是從更多的貨里賺取利潤
is if I leverage the profits from a bigger shipment.

248
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,890
要是出了差錯怎么辦
What if something else goes wrong?

249
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,010
梅塔斯集團會追殺你
The Metas will come after you.

250
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,750
不  不  他們不會追殺我
No. No, they won't come after me.

251
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,380
在我還清債務前  他們不會殺我的
They're gonna keep me alive until I've paid back the debt.

252
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,920
他們會追殺我們的家人  瑞恩
It's our family they're gonna come after, Ryan.

253
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,780
瑪茜艾拉  丹尼爾
Marciela, Daniel.

254
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,250
孩子  我需要你確保
Son... I need you to make sure

255
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,270
那批貨能安然送達
that shipment comes through,

256
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,280
因為那是我們
'cause that's the only way

257
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
保護他們的唯一方法
we are gonna be able to protect them.

258
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,300
你聽懂我的話了嗎
Do you understand me?

259
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,750
你翻我桌子干嘛
What are you doing in my desk?

260
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
怎么了  哥們兒
Oh, what's up, man?

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,930
我在找上個月
I was looking for that file

262
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,310
你和坦納繳獲海洛因案子的文件
for the heroin bust you and Tanner did last month.

263
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,800
要那個干嘛
What for?

264
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,460
我有個哥們兒
I got a guy

265
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,600
要給我一些阿科斯塔家的情報
who's gonna give me some intel on the Acostas,

266
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,830
但我得還他人情
but I gotta return the favor.

267
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,140
在這兒呢
Here it is.

268
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,290
這是我的文件  我也要去
It's my file. Means I'm coming.

269
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,600
-你開車  -好
- You can roll. - All right.

270
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,830
你這是第二次放杰西卡鴿子了吧
So what, that's the second time you bailed out on Jessica?

271
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,040
第三次
Third.

272
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,290
該死  我知道她生你的氣  哥們兒
Damn, I know she's pissed off at you, man.

273
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,080
她沒事
She's fine.

274
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,150
是啊
Yeah, right.

275
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,750
她不好  哥們兒  相信我  我了解女人
She ain't fine, man, trust me. I know women.

276
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,950
我要是你  我會用甜膩帶有愛意的拉丁嗓音
If I was you, I'd put on that sweet, lover, Latino voice,

277
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,910
胡里奧·伊格萊西亞斯那種風格的
you know, Julio Iglesias style.

278
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,510
打電話給她  跟她道歉
Call her up, apologize,

279
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,430
也許她會跟你銷魂刺激的干一場
maybe you get some wham bam going on.

280
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,130
你怎么知道我沒這么做呢
How do you know I haven't already?

281
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,770
看看你  哥們兒  你太焦慮不安了
Look at you, man. You all tensed up and anxious.

282
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,970
你得好好發泄一下  伙計
That firecracker has not been blowing off, ése.

283
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,290
我們要跟誰交換情報  哥們兒
So who's this guy we're trading intel with, man?

284
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,970
-沃倫探員  -這人是誰
- Agent Warren. - Who this guy?

285
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,880
沃倫探員  是我的好兄弟
Agent Warren, he's a good buddy of mine.

286
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,100
緝毒局特種部門的
DEA Special Ops Division.

287
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,580
特種部
Special Ops?

288
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,570
那是聯邦政府的秘密單位
That's the agency's covert unit.

289
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,600
他們專門收集信息
They specialize in gathering information.

290
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,680
都是些不錯的人  很內行
Good guys. Great at what they do,

291
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
但他們的行事作法不合常規
but they're methods are very unconventional.

292
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,600
你是說違反憲法
You mean unconstitutional.

293
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,160
查普爾說我們得找到一些
Chapel said we need to find something

294
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,230
在法庭上指證阿科斯塔的東西
we can use against Acosta in court.

295
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,370
伙計  到現在為止
Look, man, so far,

296
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,280
這條路一直行不通  不是嗎
that has not been working for us, right?

297
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,570
我不知道你怎么樣  我是受夠了
I don't know about you, man, but I'm tired of it.

298
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,980
你好啊  沃倫
What's up, Warren?

299
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,120
你幫我弄到什么了
What you got for me?

300
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,410
不一定  我的檔案呢
Depends. You got my file?

301
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,670
我監聽了幾個梅塔斯幫成員的通話
I got a wiretap on a few of the Metas.

302
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,390
他們沒說什么能用來指證阿科斯塔的話
They haven't said anything to incriminate the Acostas yet,

303
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,450
但我知道他們有一大批貨就要到了
but I can tell you they got a shipment coming in.

304
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,780
-貨運到哪里  -還不確定
- Where's it going to? - Not sure yet.

305
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,340
明天到  而且是很大一批
It's coming in tomorrow and it's a big one.

306
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,860
一千公斤
A thousand keys.

307
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,670
我們需要你監聽的那些人的名字
We need the names of those phones you tapped

308
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,980
以便進一步核實
so we can follow up.

309
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,570
我不會說的
No, you don't.

310
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,990
打獵愉快
Happy hunting.

311
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,940
這才像回事
That's my boy.

312
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,910
你怎么還拉著臉
What's with the long face, ése?

313
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,870
天上掉下個大餡餅  伙計
Christmas just came early, man.

314
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,190
恭喜  一千公斤呢
Feliz Navidad. Thousand kilos.

315
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,620
除非你能查到卸貨的地方
Except that intel you got is worth nothing

316
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,770
否則你的消息一錢不值
unless you figure out where that shipment's going.

317
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
也許查普爾的線人能幫上忙
Well, maybe Chapel's informant could help.

318
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,270
我剛剛從線人那里
Just got a tip from my CI

319
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,910
得到了那一千公斤魚鱗的消息  行動吧
on the thousand keys of Fishscale. We gotta move.

320
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,520
緝毒局說貨物明天才運到
The DEA says the shipment's coming tomorrow.

321
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,360
緝毒局錯了
The DEA was wrong.

322
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,900
那批貨已經進入美國了
The shipment already made its way into the U.S.

323
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,970
貨放在城里的一處藏匿窩點
It's being held at a stash house downtown.

324
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,730
-在哪里  -阿拉米達街的教堂
- Where? - The Iglesia de Dios on Alameda.

325
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,120
-一間教堂  -救濟會  完美的偽裝
- A church? - It's a mission. It's the perfect cover.

326
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,330
教堂的負責人皈依上帝前
The guy that runs it has a long history of drug priors

327
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,560
有一大堆毒品案底
before he found God.

328
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,970
如果那里有平民怎么辦
But what if there are people there?

329
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,330
或許我們應該等到晚上
Maybe we should wait till tonight.

330
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,190
那時候東西早就沒了
Stuff will be gone by then.

331
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,580
-只有兩個小時機會  -這情報準嗎
- We got a two-hour window. - How good is the intel?

332
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,350
絕對準
Rock solid.

333
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,370
就是給了我們"魚鱗卡車"情報的那個人
Same guy that gave us the Fishscale truck.

334
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,120
等我們拿到這批貨  掐斷他們的命脈
Well, we get that shipment, break their backs.

335
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,460
就該大獲全勝了  拜拜了  阿科斯塔
And it's game, set, match. Adios, Acosta.

336
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,990
你們一定已經聽說了這次收繳
I'm sure you both heard about the seizure.

337
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,240
當然  全世界都知道了
Yeah, the whole damn world heard about that.

338
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,920
你準備怎么補上這部分損失
How are you going to cover the loss?

339
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,220
這個不需要你關心
That's not something I need you to be involved in.

340
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,880
問題是
But the question is,

341
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,870
為什么瑞恩沒干好他的工作
why the hell wasn't Ryan doing his job?

342
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,830
是嗎  卡洛斯  你幫上什么忙了嗎
Really, Carlos? What-What were you doing to help?

343
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,150
我不是讓你們兩個來吵架的
I didn't ask you here to argue! Huh?!

344
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,160
我們這一周都要格外小心謹慎
We all need to take extra precautions this week.

345
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,450
什么意思
Meaning exactly what?

346
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,770
意思是在我解決麻煩之前
Meaning until I sort out this mess,

347
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,120
你們兩個都要避避風頭
you both need to lay low.

348
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,680
你知道我有多少次因為家里受到威脅
You know how many days of school I missed

349
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
或者可能爆發幫派戰爭
because of some threat to the family,

350
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,900
或者和警察有麻煩
or-or-or some potential gang war,

351
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,560
而請假不去學校嗎
or-or problems with the cops?

352
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,540
我已經不在學校了  爸爸
This isn't school anymore, Dad.

353
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,010
我在經營一家銀行  我不能躲出去
I run a bank, I can't afford to hide out.

354
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,790
我可以讓兩個最好的手下跟著你
I can give you two of my best men to watch your backs.

355
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,870
他們會被保護好的
They'll be protected.

356
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,570
丹尼爾
Daniel?

357
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,700
好吧
Fine.

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,910
但我不希望他們進我的銀行
But I don't want them in my bank.

359
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,320
他們可以待在外面
They could be outside,

360
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,480
只要盯著大門就可以了
just as long as they got eyes on the door.

361
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,980
好的  就這樣定了
Okay, it's settled then.

362
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,670
你還是沒說你準備怎么補上這部分損失
You still haven't said how you're gonna pay for the losses.

363
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,990
我可能有辦法能補上錢  爸爸
I might have a way to cover those funds, Dad.

364
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,040
不行  我不想再討論這個問題了
No. I'm done talking about that.

365
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,910
你不用擔心  兒子
You won't have to be concerned, son.

366
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,580
你告訴頭目們
You told the captains

367
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,180
這周貨物的目的地了嗎
about where the shipment's headed this week?

368
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
已經辦妥了
It's taken care of.

369
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,270
很好
Good.

370
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,490
我和奇諾監獄里的岡莫談過了
I talked to Gnomo up in Chino.

371
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,840
他想知道我們會怎樣安置
He wants to know what the plans are

372
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,480
監獄里的安杰利哥幫成員
for the Angelicos on the inside.

373
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,880
你怎么跟他說的
What did you tell him?

374
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,140
我告訴他這事我們會處理好
I told him they'd be taken care of,

375
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,550
但是他們想聽到你親口保證
but, uh, they want to hear it from you.

376
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,390
我正忙著抓內奸呢
I'm trying to smoke out a rat right now.

377
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,140
沒時間管這個
I don't have time for that.

378
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,520
爸爸  如果你不親自出現
Pop, you don't show face yourself,

379
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,700
岡莫和其他人會認為你不尊重他們
Gnomo and the OG's are gonna take that as an insult for sure.

380
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,500
那就由你去說服他們不要這樣
Then you make sure they don't.

381
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,660
兒子  你去  你去和他們談談
Son, you go, you talk to them.

382
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,410
他們尊重你
They respect you.

383
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,490
好心人  有零錢嗎  有...
Hey, man, y'all got some change? Y'all got...?

384
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,160
泰  小薇  你們繞到后面
Tae, Vee, you go around back,

385
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,810
等我的信號  瑞恩
wait for my signal. Ryan.

386
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,130
里面正在布道
There's a service going on.

387
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,350
不過是阿科斯塔的偽裝的一部分  行動
It's part of Acosta's cover-up. We're moving.

388
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,020
繼續  大家大點聲
Keep going. Let's go higher.

389
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,070
好了  大家注意  我們數到三進去
All right, people, we go in on three.

390
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,630
一  二  三
One, two... three.

391
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,200
別站起來  別站起來
Stay down! Sit down.

392
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,250
女士們先生們  這是場突擊搜捕
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a raid.

393
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,890
請留在原位
Stay in your seats.

394
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,890
我們會盡快結束
We'll get this done with as quickly as possible.

395
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,820
這是什么意思
What's the meaning of this?!

396
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,210
-所有人  坐下  -你們不該來這里
- Everyone, sit down! - You got no business being in here.

397
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,390
我們在做上帝的工作
We're doing the work of God.

398
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,810
我是你現在唯一需要擔心的上帝  帕爾卡
Right now, I'm the only God you have to worry about, Parca.

399
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,910
那已經不是我的名字了
That's not my name anymore.

400
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,840
不再是了
No es más.

401
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,490
你們還是走吧
Why don't you get out of here?

402
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,010
毒品在哪
Where are the drugs?

403
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,520
什么毒品  這里沒有毒品
What drugs? There are no drugs!

404
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,890
把這地方翻個底朝天
Take this place apart!

405
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,770
請大家不要激動
Guys, take it easy.

406
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,850
所有人坐下  保持冷靜
Sit down, everyone. Stay calm.

407
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,350
一小包大麻  你怎么回事  伙計
A dime bag of weed? What's wrong with you, man?

408
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,880
你差點為了這個挨槍子
You could have got shot for that!

409
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,890
房間里沒有
Their rooms are clear,

410
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,470
但后面有一個鎖著的儲藏室
but there's a locked storage room in the back.

411
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,660
鑰匙在哪
Where is the key?

412
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,320
他是我們的牧師  求你了
He's our pastor! Please!

413
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,460
賈維爾·阿科斯塔也是你的教民嗎
Javier Acosta one of your parishioners?

414
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,330
鑰匙在那邊
Look behind there.

415
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,920
好了  帶上他
Bingo. Bring him.

416
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,760
別擔心  一切都好
Hey, don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

417
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,990
兄弟  請你們不要
Hey, brother, please don't.

418
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,810
這里沒有毒品  我發誓
There's no drugs in here, I swear.

419
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,570
別這樣  兄弟  聽我好好說
Come on, brother. Let me talk to you, man.

420
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,830
不要這樣做  別這樣  伙計
You ain't gotta do that, ése. Come on, man.

421
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,730
毒品在哪里
Where are the drugs?!

422
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,820
我告訴你了  沒有毒品
I told you, no drugs.

423
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,830
這都是給無家可歸的人的
This is for the homeless, man.

424
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,490
我們花了六個月時間才搜集到的
It took us six months to collect this.

425
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,220
他們需要這些食物  這是他們的一切
They need this food. That's all they have.

426
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,890
隊長  這地方沒有毒品
Captain, this place is clean, man.

427
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,180
我和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

428
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,390
滾一邊去
The hell you are.

429
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,310
如果你的線人給你假情報
If your CI gave you bad intel on purpose,

430
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,890
說明他可能投敵了
that means he could be compromised.

431
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,420
你去可能正中圈套
You could be going right into an ambush.

432
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,310
好吧  我確實需要后援
All right, I could use the backup.

433
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,120
你說過你不會帶任何人來
You said you weren't gonna bring nobody.

434
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,420
你還說過毒品就在教堂呢
And you said the drugs were at the church!

435
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,140
你和賈維爾設圈套耍我  盧喬
You and Javier set me up, Lucho.

436
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,110
讓我看起來像個傻瓜
Tried to make me look like a fool.

437
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,630
賈維爾說他們要去那里
Javier-Javier said they were headed there,

438
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,030
梅塔斯幫的人要親自送貨
that the Metas wanted to deliver the drugs themselves,

439
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,230
讓我不要管
for me to stay clear.

440
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,900
-可我們有約定  -隊長
- But we... we had a deal! - Captain...

441
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,570
隊長  安杰利哥幫會處理他的
Captain! Los Angelicos are gonna take care of this guy.

442
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,170
賈維爾正在引蛇出洞
I think Javier was trying to smoke out his rat,

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,360
給手下人錯誤信息  看是誰泄的密
feeding his men fake intel, seeing who dropped the dime.

444
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,390
我跟你保證賈維爾的人
I guarantee you Javier's men are out there

445
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,790
正等著干掉你呢
looking to kill you right now.

446
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,200
我的人說的沒錯  盧喬  我很確定
If my officer is right, Lucho-- and I'm sure he is--

447
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,710
你現在只是在茍延殘喘
you're living on borrowed time.

448
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,070
好好享受吧  祝你好運
Enjoy that. Good luck.

449
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,380
等等  你不能就這么丟下我
Wait. You can't just leave me here.

450
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,200
你得  你得幫我
You got, you gotta help me.

451
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,260
你對我已經沒用了
You're no use to me anymore.

452
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,610
要是我知道一些東西呢
What if I know something?

453
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,770
通常要出事兒之前
Usually, when something's about to go down...

454
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,370
有人要被逮了或者有突擊搜查
an arrest or a bust...

455
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,160
賈維爾都會警告我們
Javier warns us.

456
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,350
你想說什么
What are you saying?

457
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,640
賈維爾有個內應
Javier has a mole.

458
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,330
你真覺得阿科斯塔在組里安插了人嗎
You really think Acosta has somebody inside the department?

459
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,100
他肯定不是第一個想這么做的
He wouldn't be the first to try.

460
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,640
我不知道
I don't know.

461
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,970
盧喬太想保命  你覺得我們能信他嗎
Lucho's desperate. You think we can trust him?

462
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,440
如果他說的沒錯  我們擔不起這個風險
If he's right, we can't afford not to.

463
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,740
反黑組有67個人
We've got 67 people working in the GTF.

464
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,200
他們每天都跟洛杉磯警局
They're dealing with LAPD,

465
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,740
移民局 調查局還有緝毒局打交道
ICE, FBI, DEA.

466
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,590
我們每天要跟400人聯系
That's 400 people that we talk to on a daily basis.

467
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,750
如果他們中有內奸  一定得找出來
If any one of them is on the take, we gotta find out.

468
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,060
這是基金的年度許可
And there's the annual affirmation for the fund.

469
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,400
很好  現在進展如何
Great. How're we doing?

470
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,030
丹尼  從你投了兩百萬到現在
Well, Danny, since your two mil came in,

471
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,950
我們基金漲了百分之十
our funds have grown ten percent.

472
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,340
那可真
Wow, that's...

473
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,370
-那可真不錯  -我知道
- that's amazing. - I know.

474
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,350
在辦公室他們都叫你幸運星呢
At the office, they're calling you our lucky centavo.

475
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,330
還有機會再投一點嗎
Hey, is-is there still time to invest more?

476
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,360
你想投多少
How much you thinking?

477
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,880
第一筆投資翻一倍
Uh, double my initial investment.

478
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,130
四百萬
Four mil?

479
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,560
對
Yeah.

480
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,030
沒問題
You got it.

481
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,500
太好了
Yes!

482
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,110
你把錢打過來我們再談下一步
You wire over the funds, we'll go from there, huh?

483
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,700
好
Yep.

484
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,080
那周日高爾夫球場見
Hey, I'm gonna see you on the links on Sunday?

485
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,470
當然  我會去
Yeah, yeah, you know it.

486
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,720
到時見
I'll see you.

487
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,300
各位  聽好了
Okay, everybody, listen up.

488
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,200
我需要你們的手機
I need your phones.

489
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,360
把它們交上來
Bring them in.

490
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,190
這是要干什么
What's this all about?

491
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,450
把手機全都拿過來
Right here. Bring them in. Phones.

492
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,990
私人手機也要
Personal phones, too.

493
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,760
看來特里薩今晚得不到補償了
Guess Theresa won't be getting her booty call tonight.

494
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,570
到底是怎么回事  隊長
What's the deal, Captain?

495
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,630
我們可能有內奸
We may have a leak.

496
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,460
反黑組要做一次
The force has initiated

497
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,140
全部門排查
a department-wide sweep to make sure

498
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,840
以確保沒有人的電話被監聽
none of our cell phones are tapped.

499
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,520
技術小組也會來檢查辦公室
We're also bringing in tech teams to check the offices

500
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,330
確保無線設備和電腦里沒有木馬
for wires and the computers for spyware.

501
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,200
小薇  最好把你那些黑人小黃片都刪了
Hey, Vee, you better delete all that chocolate porn you have in there.

502
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,410
你最好把你押的橄欖球隊給刪掉
You better delete your fantasy football team.

503
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,550
真是太不會選隊了
Your picks were embarrassing.

504
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,040
在所有人的設備檢查完畢之前
Until everybody's equipment's been checked, 

505
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,970
禁止一切通訊
we will be on a communications lockdown.

506
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,250
也就是說不能打手機或者座機
That means no cell phones, no landlines,

507
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,610
沒有網絡也沒有傳真
no Internet and no fax.

508
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,520
我們還用傳真機嗎
We still have fax?

509
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,910
沒有科技設備我們要怎么追查運毒的事兒
How are we supposed to track this shipment without our tech gear?

510
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,330
用最原始的方式
The old-fashioned way.

511
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,360
人力
In person.

512
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,510
我們可以先去拜訪一下
And we'll start with getting a visit

513
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,830
你那些線人
from your special ops contact.

514
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,980
給你  先生
Sir.

515
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,520
聽著  盧喬
You know, Lucho,

516
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
所謂保護線人
this thing about informants is

517
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,320
其實有非常多的限制
they're kept on a short leash.

518
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,320
對他們的保護也取決于抓他們的人
And their protection is at the whim of the people holding them.

519
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,860
我已經把知道的都告訴你了
I already told you everything.

520
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,790
不  你說賈維爾·阿科斯塔可能有內應
No, you didn't. You told me Javier Acosta might have a mole.

521
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,070
可你沒說是誰
You didn't say who it was.

522
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,480
這里是我手下67個人的照片
These are pictures of the 67 people that work in my unit.

523
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,170
我希望你能仔細看一下
I want you to look at these carefully.

524
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,690
告訴我有沒有你眼熟的
Tell me if you recognize any of the faces.

525
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,740
我一個人都不認識
I... I don't know none of them.

526
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,770
我都不知道是不是真的有內應
I don't even know if it's real.

527
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,050
我已經做這行足夠久了
You know, I've been in this game long enough to know

528
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,400
我知道線人都喜歡留點底牌
that informants always save something big in case they need it.

529
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,100
可惜的是
Well, guess what?

530
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,960
警察也一樣
So do cops.

531
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,700
{\an8}犯人移交書

532
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,360
這是什么
What's this?

533
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,280
自己看
Read it.

534
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,050
"十六起雞奸  二十三起強奸"
"16 counts of sodomy, 23 counts of rape."

535
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,890
你要是不把我想知道的告訴我
You don't give me what I want,

536
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,350
他就會是你兒子的新獄友
that's your son's new cell mate.

537
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,540
請別這樣
Please don't.

538
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,380
你兒子將會經常這么說
Your son's gonna be saying that a lot.

539
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,940
我不知道是誰
I don't know who it is.

540
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,050
我發誓
I swear.

541
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,350
丹尼爾  這是麗莎·布洛迪
Daniel, this is, uh, Lisa Brody.

542
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,400
她是S&C信托公司.的代表
She's a representative from S&C TrustCo.

543
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,150
也是本行的機構貸款人
Our bank's institutional lender.

544
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,670
我知道我沒有預約
So, I know I don't have an appointment,

545
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,630
但我想跟你聊一下你的財務報表
but I wanted to talk to you about your financial statements.

546
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,470
好的  你想進辦公室談嗎
Uh, yeah. You-you want to step in the office?

547
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,210
我還以為審核要半年之后呢
I thought the review wasn't supposed to be for another six months.

548
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,160
沒錯  可是
That's correct, but, you know,

549
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,320
鑒于經濟危機以及數家銀行倒閉
with the crisis and so many banks failing,

550
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,800
我們想增加對較小型銀行的抽查
we just like to check in on our smaller banks every now and then.

551
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,600
有道理
Right.

552
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,320
有一位客戶經理發現
One of our account managers noticed you'd taken

553
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,730
你高倉持有陽光在線對沖基金
a strong position in the SunnyLinks hedge fund.

554
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,420
我們希望盡量能
Well, we were hoping to hold our position

555
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,840
長期持有陽光在線
at SunnyLinks as long as possible.

556
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,350
這對本社區的居民有好處
I mean, it's-it's great for the people in this community.

557
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,240
這種好機會不多見的
You know, we don't get opportunities like that.

558
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,980
可是我們的貸款政策明確指出
But our lender's policy specifically states

559
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,970
資金的百分之八十必須投入穩健股票
that 80% of your money has to be in conservative stocks.

560
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,160
作為貸款方  我們給的條款都有我們的道理
As lenders, we have covenants for a reason.

561
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,620
不僅是在保護我們  也是在保護你
Not just to protect us, but you as well.

562
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,060
我們要求你在本周內
We're gonna need you to move the funds back

563
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,200
將資金回籠
before the end of the week

564
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,410
否則我們可能會強制撤回資金
or we may be forced to pull our backing.

565
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,470
明白了嗎
All right?

566
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,610
當然
Of course.

567
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,250
如您所愿
Whatever you need.

568
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,690
關于魚鱗的運輸有進展嗎
Any news on the Fishscale shipment?

569
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,670
沒有  梅塔斯不討論這事
No. Metas aren't talking about it.

570
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,610
-他們非常謹慎  -那他們都聊些什么
- They're being cautious. - What are they talking about?

571
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,270
除了傻逼的橄欖球
Well, besides the crap about footbol,

572
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,890
還有斗雞和墨西哥摔跤
and cockfighting and Mexican wrestling,

573
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,740
他們還說要事先安排武裝力量
they're talking about putting soldiers in place in case, uh,

574
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,150
以免阿科斯塔的事出問題
things go south with the Acostas.

575
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,650
可他們肯定不會干掉自己最大的分包商
But they won't kill their number one distributer.

576
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,520
那當然
That's for sure.

577
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,730
不  他們會找上他的家人
No. They'll go after his family.

578
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,160
梅塔斯的游戲規則
That's the Metas' playbook.

579
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,720
攻其必救
Hit the Acostas where it hurts.

580
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,410
很好  就讓他們狗咬狗吧
Good. Let the wolves eat the wolves.

581
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,350
沒錯
Exactly.

582
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,410
有消息隨時通知我  
I'll let you know if I hear anything. 

583
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,260
謝了  沃倫
All right, thanks, Warren.

584
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,500
阿科斯塔的妻兒們
Some of the Acostas' kids, wife,

585
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,310
不該落得如此下場
they don't deserve to get caught up in this.

586
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,340
胡說
The hell they don't.

587
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,980
那家人沒一個是無辜的
Nobody in that family is innocent.

588
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,890
你覺得沒有他老爹的臟錢
You think Daniel could open that bank

589
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,170
丹尼爾能開得了銀行嗎
without his old man's blood money?

590
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,210
你覺得瑪茜艾拉跟了她三十五年
You think Marciela's been with him for 35 years

591
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,430
卻絲毫未享受壓寨夫人的福利嗎
without enjoying the perks of being a kingpin's wife?

592
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,670
所以他們就該去死嗎
So, they deserve to die?

593
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,330
賈維爾一家的下場如何
It-it's not my job to worry about 

594
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,600
跟我沒有任何關系
what happens to Javier's family.

595
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,940
我的職責是抓到他運毒
It's job to bust his shipment.

596
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,300
我跟你說件事  隊長
Well, I tell you one thing, Captain.

597
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,070
除非梅塔斯的人再談起他們的運貨路線
Unless these Metas start talking about their routes again,

598
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,260
我們什么都抓不到
we ain't gonna be busting nothing.

599
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,720
我知道  我有個法子能解決這個問題
I know. I think I got a way to make that happen.

600
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:33,960
我有些消息
I got some news.

601
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,120
他們突襲了林蔭大道上的教堂
They busted the church on Alameda.

602
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,030
你給條子放假消息揪出內奸這招奏效了
Your idea to smoke out the rat by feeding our captains fake intel worked.

603
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,120
所以  盧喬就是內奸嗎
So, Lucho's my rat?

604
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,340
他在哪兒
Where is he?

605
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,630
我想親手解決他
I want to take care of him myself.

606
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,440
對不起  老大
Sorry, boss.

607
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,330
我們到處都找了
We searched everywhere.

608
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,750
看來那哥們跑路了
It looks like the vato's gone.

609
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,050
你問過瑞恩嗎
You ask Ryan?

610
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,310
他沒接電話
He's still not answering.

611
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,900
但樓下有人找你
But you have a visitor downstairs.

612
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,560
讓他等著
Tell him to wait.

613
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,120
我覺得你想見這個人
I think you might want to see this.

614
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,480
你收藏的威士忌真不錯啊
You have a great selection of scotch here.

615
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,340
糟糕的一天過后
This is a nice place to 

616
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,140
這是個好地方來放松一下
unwind at the end of a hard day.

617
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,060
我對教堂的事深表遺憾  查普爾
Sorry about what happened at the church, Chapel.

618
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,780
我希望這不會太讓你難堪
I hope it doesn't cause you too much embarrassment.

619
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,590
沒錯  我得
Yeah, I got,

620
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,970
我得恭喜你
I got to hand it to you.

621
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,930
用教堂來試探  這招不錯
The church was a nice touch.

622
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,050
我還以為你會感激我
Thought you'd appreciate that.

623
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,060
為了讓你不再自取其辱  我跟你直說吧
Allow me to save you from further humiliation by telling you, 

624
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,960
你的線人盧喬知之甚少  沒法幫你了
your informant Lucho doesn't know anything more that can help you.

625
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,820
對我來說  好消息是安杰利哥幫愿意幫忙的
Well, the good news for me is he's not the only Angelico

626
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,690
不只他一個
who's willing to talk.

627
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,320
正和你意  對吧
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

628
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,360
我們都心知肚明你的線人只有一個
We both know you don't have another informant.

629
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,070
你知道
You do know

630
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,660
你最信任的那個人
that the people you trust the most

631
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,120
會是最終抓你的那個人  對吧
are the ones who get you in end, don't you?

632
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,310
你到底來干嘛
Why are you here?

633
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,420
出于職業道德  賈維爾
Professional courtesy, Javier.

634
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,920
我覺得二十年過去了
I thought after 20 years, 

635
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,070
我至少也該給你一個做好事的機會
the least I could do is give you the opportunity to do the right thing.

636
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,380
真的嗎
Really?

637
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,940
那是什么
What's that?

638
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,610
保護好你的家庭
Protect your family.

639
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,850
我絕對有能力保護好我的家庭
I'm more than capable of doing that on my own.

640
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,010
不會了
But you won't be.

641
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,930
明天早晨等我收繳了你那一噸貨
Not after I bust the thousand keys

642
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,360
你就沒法再保護你的家庭了
you have coming in tomorrow morning.

643
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,660
你得逞不了的  查普爾
That another White Whale, Chapel?

644
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,960
這次不是了
Not this time.

645
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,730
我知道等你付不出錢時
See, I know what the Metas will do

646
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,030
梅塔斯一定會對你家人下手
to your family when you can't pay.

647
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,620
你現在就自首
You turn yourself in right now,

648
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,730
我讓你全家加入證人保護計劃
I'll put them all in Witness Protection.

649
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,300
我對你保證
You have my word on that.

650
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,910
問題是  查普爾
The problem, Chapel,

651
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,740
我知道你的保證意味著什么
is I know what your word means.

652
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,590
狗屁不是
Nothing.

653
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,630
跟你的情報一樣
Just like your intel.

654
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,690
看來我們只能拭目以待了
I guess we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

655
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,360
你知道莫比·迪克最后怎么樣了吧
You know what happened at the end of Moby Dick, right?

656
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,710
那只白鯨嗎
The whale?

657
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,140
它殺了所有人
He killed everyone.

658
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,710
你覺得他在虛張聲勢嗎
You think he's bluffing?

659
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,690
我不知道
I don't know.

660
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,250
但我們不能冒險
But we can't take any chances.

661
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,730
給梅塔斯發條編碼信息
Send a coded message to the Metas.

662
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,500
我們得重新規劃運貨路線
We got to reroute the shipment.

663
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,410
我不知道你昨晚干了什么  但它奏效了
I don't know what you did last night, Captain, but it worked.

664
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,370
沃倫說他又聯絡梅塔斯了
Warren said the Metas are communicating again.

665
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,370
很好  他們說了什么
Good, what are they saying?

666
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,130
他們沒在說話  他們在放歌
They're not saying, they're singing.

667
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,990
一遍遍地重復播放這首梅倫格舞曲
Keep playing this merengue crap over and over.

668
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,120
這是個編碼  他們知道我們在竊聽
It's a code. They know we're listening.

669
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,060
這個詞是什么意思嗎
What does that mean-- Tiburón?

670
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,650
鯊魚
It means "Shark."

671
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,920
或許代表著船
Maybe it's a boat.

672
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,860
上次我們抓到他們陸運
I mean, last time we busted their trucks,

673
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,690
所以現在他們海運貨物了
so now they're moving the shipment by sea.

674
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,130
瑪麗安德爾灣里有個鯊魚碼頭
There's a Tiburón Pier in Marina del Rey.

675
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,910
等等
Now, hold on.

676
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,790
他們放了兩遍
They're playing the song twice,

677
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,900
每遍暫停的時間點都不同
and stopping it a different place each time.

678
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,970
這是個序列  聽著
It's a sequence, look.

679
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,730
第一次暫停是在33秒時
First time they stop it at 33,

680
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,840
然后是44秒
then 44,

681
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,510
3分42秒
3:42.

682
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,080
第二遍在1分18秒和1分54秒暫停
The second time it's at 1:18 and 1:54.

683
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,180
或許這是船只注冊號
Maybe it's boat registration numbers.

684
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,500
不對  注冊號的位數沒那么多
No, that's too many numbers.

685
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,680
他們要進如此大量的貨
Maybe they're bringing in two boats.

686
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,880
或許是要用兩艘船運
A shipment that big.

687
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,900
十三位數
13 numbers.

688
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,610
可能是坐標
Could be coordinates.

689
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,010
膜拜哥吧
Choke my chicken, man.

690

新港紐斯船塢
Newport Shipyard.

692
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,880
這是個修船廠
It's a repair yard.

693
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,390
船只過往稀少
Very little traffic.

694
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,150
完美地點
It's perfect.

695
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,890
準備行動
Let's gear up.

至少有十二個全副武裝的

697
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,450
安杰利哥幫打手在護送這批貨
Angelico soldiers guarding this shipment.

698
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,620
我們得全力以赴
We need to be on our A-game, people.

699
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,880
他們發現我們了  小心點
They've spotted us! Be careful!

700
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,890
警員中槍

有警察受傷
Officer down!

702
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,240
干掉他們  拿到那批貨
Take them out! Get that shipment!

703
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,450
這些是安杰利哥幫的打手
Those are Los Angelico soldiers.

704
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,060
我發現六個

705
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,650
{\an8}芭芭拉號
瑪麗安德爾灣

706
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,500
他們在燒毀毒品
They're burning the drugs!

707
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,690
泰  小薇  掩護我們  我們得趕快移動了
Tae, Vee, give us some cover. We're gonna move.

708
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,800
洛佩茲
Lopez!

709
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,670
洛佩茲去哪兒了
Where the hell is Lopez?

710
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,570
走  快走
Go! Just go!

711
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,770
別開槍

712
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,640
別開槍  住手

713
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,160
你得馬上沉船

714
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
別開槍  住手

715
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,650
-我沒看到毒品  -洛佩茲  報告你的位置
- I don't see the drugs. - Lopez, what's your 20?

716
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,960
洛佩茲  再說一遍  報告你的位置
Lopez, repeat, what's your 20?

717
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,700
我看到你跑過去  怎么了
I saw you running over here. What happened?

718
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,240
他們想要沉船
They were trying to sink the sub!

719
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,610
幫我關閘
Help me close the vents.

720
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,940
我的天吶
I'll be damned.

721
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,950
找到了
We got it.

722
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,630
是啊
Yeah.

723
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,530
卡洛斯
Hey, Carlos!

724
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,580
兄弟
Orale, carnal.

725
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,360
卡洛斯
Carlos.

726
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,610
這個月的錢
This month's package.

727
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,090
謝謝
Gracias.

728
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,080
我還以為會是你父親來
I thought your father was coming.

729
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,760
我父親讓我轉達
My father asked me to relay a message.

730
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,240
所有的兄弟  退休的和終身監禁的
All the homeys, the OGs and the lifers,

731
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,030
幫里會照顧好你們
they're all gonna be taken care of.

732
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,300
只要還有一個安杰利哥幫成員被關在這兒
As long as there's a single Angelico locked up in here,

733
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,330
我父親就會繼續交保護費
my father will continue to pay the fees

734
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,750
保證你們的安全
to insure your protection.

735
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,110
那些出獄的會怎么樣
What about those of us getting out?

736
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,100
他們嗎
What about them?

737
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,090
他們可以像我們其他人一樣混白道
They can go straight like the rest of us, eh?

738
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,980
我父親買下了幾家餐館和幾棟公寓
My father's buying restaurants and apartment buildings

739
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,910
可以給他們提供很多工作崗位
so there will be plenty of J-O-Bs for them.

740
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,790
比如清潔工  服務生
Like janitors, waiters

741
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,470
這類的活計嗎
and things like that?

742
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,840
總得先起步  再一步步往上爬
Hey, you got to start somewhere then work your way up.

743
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,240
你懂什么
Tú no sabes qué?

744
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
我已經是高層了  伙計
I'm already up, homes.

745
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,550
我一出獄  就要回幫里
Soon as I get out, I'm gonna go back to the hood,

746
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,680
賣毒品  每天賺大錢
sling dope, make a grand a day.

747
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,940
我也想走正道
I'm all for going legit,

748
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,370
但我有三個孩子
but I got three kids.

749
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,520
拿最低工資怎么糊口
I can't live on no minimum wage.

750
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,200
你知道嗎
Y sabes qué?

751
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,670
這兒的大多數人都不行
Most of the homeys in here can't either.

752
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,350
好吧  放心  岡莫
All right, easy, Gnomo.

753
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,500
你會有很多生活費
You'll have plenty of cash to live on.

754
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,470
我保證照顧好你
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

755
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,870
就像你照顧我弟弟一樣嗎
Like you took care of my brother?

756
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,300
你想說什么  蠢貨
Something you want to say, ese?

757
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,400
你知道
You know,

758
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,520
你父親至少要做到
the least your father could have done

759
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,860
尊重我們  當面跟我們說
is had the respect to come tell this to our face.

760
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,140
但他不尊重我們
But he doesn't respect us,

761
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,300
他也不尊重你  伙計
and he doesn't respect you, homes.

762
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,060
看看你
I mean, look at you, ese.

763
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,850
你有什么實力
You running a clica of what?

764
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,310
就20個人
20 guys?

765
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,860
如果你父親信任你
If your father believed in you,

766
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,520
他會讓你管理街區
it would be you running the streets,

767
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,990
而不是戈多
not Tio Gordo.

768
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,250
賈維爾洗白后會怎樣
And what happens when Javier gets out?

769
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,610
你真以為在你老爸的新世界里
Do you really think in his new world order

770
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,070
他會讓你管事嗎
your daddy is gonna let you run his spreadsheets?

771
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,460
不會的  到時候就是丹尼爾掌權了
Nah, homes, it's gonna be Daniel in charge.

772
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,350
幫我個忙  伙計
So do me a favor, homes,

773
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,190
別告訴我你一絲油水都撈不到
don't tell me you're gonna be taking care of nothing.

774
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,550
但你想想  岡莫
Yeah, but check this out, Gnomo.

775
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,040
家族要洗白了
The family is going... legit.

776
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,880
無論你愿不愿意
Whether you like it or not.

777
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,420
你要么就抓住
So you can either take the opportunity

778
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,970
我們好心給你的機會
that we are most so kindly handing to you,

779
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,760
要么你就自力更生吧
or you can take a dive all on your own, ese.

780
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,190
你自己選
That's your call.

781
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,680
去死吧  伙計
Well, screw that, homes.

782
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,820
我寧愿在地獄當老大  也不愿去天堂跑腿
I'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.

783
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,950
你我都知道  你也是這樣
And we both know you would, too.

784
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,490
是嗎
Yeah?

785
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,930
無論如何
Whether that's true or not,

786
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,270
這是未來趨勢
the future's coming, 

787
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,260
你我都無力阻止
and there ain't nothing you and me can do about it.

788
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,440
你聽說過36法案嗎
Hey, did you hear about Prop 36? Hmm?

789
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,060
他們會允許大部分三進宮的犯人保釋
They're gonna be letting most of the three strikers out.

790
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,570
下個月有至少幾百人要出獄
That's at least a couple of hundred of us in the next month.

791
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,200
小心點  岡莫
Cuidado, Gnomo.

792
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
你在威脅我嗎
You threatening me?

793
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,660
不
Nah, homes.

794
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,740
我是說  如果你父親想洗白
All I'm saying is if your father wants to go legit,

795
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,600
隨便他
let him.

796
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:00,910
但我們不用洗白
But we don't have to.

797
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,920
我們只需要一個新領袖
All we need is a new leader to hold the keys.

798
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,180
還有我的錢  和他們的
And my money and theirs,

799
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,950
我們的錢都指望你了  卡洛斯
our money is on you, Carlos.

800
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,240
這是反黑組兩天內展開的
This is the second major drug bust

801
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,090
第二次大規模緝毒活動
for the Gang Task Force in just under 48 hours.

802
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,630
繳獲的魚鱗海洛因總量
The total amount of Fishscale cocaine seized,

803
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,090
高達2600磅
a whopping 2,600 pounds.

804
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,740
總價值超過一億兩千萬
The street value, over $120 million.

805
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,530
查普爾隊長  此次行動大獲成功
Captain Chapel, this is such a momentous win.

806
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,300
你感覺如何
How do you feel?

807
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,910
我感覺如何
How do I feel?

808
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,690
我損失了兩個優秀的手下
I feel like I lost two good men today,

809
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,420
但我為反黑組感到驕傲
but I'm proud of the GTF team.

810
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,340
是他們  他們是勇氣
It's them, it's their courage

811
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,090
才能繳獲如此大量的毒品
that makes seizures like this possible.

812
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,860
你找到了潛艇  好樣的
Hey, nice catch on that sub.

813
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,390
謝謝
Yeah, thanks.

814
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,610
有件事我沒搞懂
There's just one thing I don't get.

815
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,240
那艘船著火的時候  你卻跑向了另一邊
When that boat started to burn, you ran the other way.

816
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
我感覺不對勁
Something didn't feel right.

817
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,450
感覺像是聲東擊西
It felt like it was a diversion or something.

818
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,310
我看過去  發現了潛艇
I looked over and, uh, caught a glimpse of the sub.

819
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,930
趕在他們沉船前跑了過去
Ran before they could scuttle it.

820
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,540
卡修斯在無線電上找你
Cassius hit you on the two-way.

821
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,910
你怎么不回話
Why didn't you just radio him back?

822
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,430
我在跟人交火呢
I was taking fire, hauling ass.

823
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,330
沒時間
Didn't have any time.

824
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,270
總之  今天真是大獲成功
Anyway, man, that was a huge bust today.

825
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,640
一切就這么發生了
I mean, when things come together like this,

826
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,500
這感覺真是太棒了  不是嗎
it's the best feeling in the world, isn't it?

827
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,890
是啊
Yeah, totally.

828
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,530
好樣的  伙計
